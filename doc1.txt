Feeling very blue today. We found out that Barney is very sick. He’s my beloved Golden Retriever pup. Well, he’s not a pup anymore, he is 12, but for me he always will be. The vet said he’s developed some kinda kidney disease. I worry if it’s too late to fix it at this point, the vet seemed worried as well. I have been trying to spend as much time with Barney as possible. Poor thing seems to be suffering. I feel super helpless and useless. I just wish we caught it earlier. There is a slight glimpse of hope though. Another vet said he might still recover. Unlikely but it might happen. Having a hard time focusing on my school or anything else. I tend to lose focus fast even when things are normal but especially right now. Everyone is stressing out about Barney and expecting the worst to happen. It’s heartbreaking. My younger brother Peter is very emotional. I mean I’m emotional but he’s taking it to another level. My parents are sad too. He has been part of our lives for so long that it’s hard to imagine otherwise. The one that’s always there for you and loves you unconditionally. I seem to be the only one who believes he’s gonna make it.
