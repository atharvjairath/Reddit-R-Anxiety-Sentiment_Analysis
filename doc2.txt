Had a huge fight with my mom today. I don’t like fighting and tend to avoid conflict. But my mom has no problem lashing out. She was saying very mean things about my dad. My mom & dad are divorced, and he recently started another family. I am also struggling to accept it. My dad canceled on me AGAIN. I was very looking forward to our dinner. I should also mention that he JUST had another daughter. I understand he’s busy and all, but feeling rather neglected. He promised I would always be his priority, but it doesn’t look like it. Perhaps I shouldn’t have fought with my mom yesterday. Is she right about him? Maybe he is selfish. 
Decided to take my mind off my family drama. I love working out in my gym and today I saw an ad about marathon training. So I immediately signed up. I already did a half marathon before and loved it. Time to extend my horizons. It’s gonna be intense, but I’m ready. We’ll see how far I’ll go, but I feel determined.
