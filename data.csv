Going for my first job interview ever tomorrow and looking for advice,I (16m) am having my first job interview tomorrow and am really nervous. I struggle with social anxiety and was wondering if anyone here has any tips when it comes to the interview as to how to calm myself down. Thanks
Fear and anxiety creeping back into my life,"I recently went to a party for a friends birthday, got drunk and spoke to people I knew from my past. I stupidly said a lot of macho rubbish about run ins with people who are now quite sinister criminals. 

I didn’t sleep last night due to stomach cramps all night, going over what could happen a million times over. Petrified that something will come and take the good out of my life somehow. 

My youth was filled with this fear and anxiety because I was in with the wrong crowds the whole way. 

My life is a lot more normal now and I have good things happening.

I am just scared."
Strong coffee and energy drinks,I really like coffee and energy drinks but I don't know if I can't drink it with strong anxiety ?
Out of lockdown,"So in Victoria , Australia, we’re still in lock down and have been 200 days now.
My biggest anxiety isn’t getting COVID, but it’s realising that when everything opens up again that I’ll probably still be at home on the weekends and everyone else will be out and about with their other group of friends 

It’s very daunting to me and as much as I hate not being able to go out , I also feel safe knowing that EVERYONE is at home not doing anything and I’m not suffering from major FMO
Please tell me if anyone else feels or felt this way?"
27(M) - Anxiety throat (trigger) (please consider this),"Anxiety in Swallowing:
Morning fellow redditors. I thought a lot about writing or not a post in here, but here I am. It’s been 16 days now from when it all started. I was out for the weekend with my Gf and we were enjoying our time, until when I started feeling something weird in my throat, almost like it was swollen. We were having a glass of wine and I was smoking a cigarette. Since I suffer from acid reflux I reckoned it was better off to quit with the cigs for the day, then we headed to dinner. There, I started realizing how swallowing food felt weird and I couldn’t do it no more. I stopped eating and became a little paranoid over it. Roughly 40 minutes after it, as we were walking in the city. I had an anxiety attack, and I couldn’t hold myself. My girl was there for me and tried to keep me calm, nonetheless I didn’t feel like walking or catching a metro to come home, since my Heart felt like coming out my chest. We got a taxi and headed back to the hotel, where I was able to calm down (struggling a bit) and fall asleep. The day after we sort of enjoyed our day but I didn’t feel like eating anything solid. I went asap to see a throat doctor , which told me my tonsils were a bit swollen because I got some little pieces of food stuck in it (due to the structure of the same). I started treating both my throat and my acid reflux now, but still I’m having troubles to eat, especially when I’m outside in crowded cities, where anxiety attacks me out of nowhere. My biggest fear now is to talk too much about it, and influence my beloved ones, which does nothing but giving me lots of more anxiety. I’m seeing a Therapist on Wednesday and I’m taking just some plant-based medications at the moment, open to suggestions though.."
Vent,"I hate it when people tone down anxiety. When I was going back to school nobody really understood that I felt like my lungs and heart were being ripped out and eaten in front of me every second. All they think is I'm being like ""oh little bit nervous teehee 👉👈 I wonder who's gonna talk to me.""

No

Just no

""Are you anxious about school? Awwwe don't worry we all are"" are you puking due to the intense anxiety you feel every morning just by the thought of school? Are you ripping at your skin in class without even knowing because you can't handle not knowing what everyone is thinking or doing? Do you break down when you have to talk to the teachers about going to the bathroom and when you do get permission to go to the bathroom you end up not going out of fear that the teacher was probably joking with you? So far people who say ""aww we all get anxious about school"" don't. Most of the time they think anxiety is just being shy. I fricken hate all of this.

It's even worse when they think I hate school because of the learning portion. I love learning! I would rather do it in a safe environment where nobody is forced to speak to me. Nobody once he at school. All the teachers want are money.

Years 
And years
And years and years and years of being in schools that didn't give a crap about me and only cared about my brother even though I was so close to stabbing my arm at times to avoid school.

My new school is much better but the principal scares me. She smiles too much. They all smile too much. It's fake.

I just don't want to thinks anymore. I wish I was only just shy."
First day of internship tomorrow,"I was accepted to an internship and I start tomorrow. I am so anxious I can’t sleep. I have to be up early, and there’s still so many things I have to do. It’s 2 am and I’m still up.


I am so incredibly nervous. I feel like I’m gonna screw this up somehow."
How do you choose a university bachelor’s degree if you’re clouded by excessive thoughts?,"To make a long story short; I’ve been debating for months on what I want to study. It’s come so far that the semester just began and I’m not enrolled yet. My mind and heart have figuratively been debating between five different options. They all seem interesting and each have their pros and cons although fear of failure and under qualification holds me back for two of them. I’ve noticed my mind tries to look more at possible outcomes for each of them rather than if I’d enjoy the subject. That makes it so hard to weigh out your likes versus practicality. 

Anyway, sorry for the long text. If any you could give some advice, I’d appreciate it much!"
How to stop thinking worst-case scenario ?,
Zoloft,"Hi. Just wondering about how people found starting on Zoloft?

I’m on day five and can already feel a difference with my anxiety. However I’m exhausted, I fell asleep sitting up the other night minutes after feeling slightly tired?

Just curious if this happened anyone else in the beginning and how long it took to regulate for you?"
Nausea: difference between sickness and anxiety,"When I am anxious it’s very hard to tell if I’m feeling nauseous and feeling like throwing up because I really got sick( like a bug, Stomach flu, food poisoning)  or if it’s anxiety/IBS. Do you know how to tell the difference ? How?"
Intentionally making myself feel like a shitty person,"I try to intentionally make myself feel bad for random shit by telling myself that I don’t feel bad that will mean I’m a bad person. Recently, my teacher acknowledged me by saying ‘ so you are back’ in a mocking tone, since I always avoid answering in class either by skipping it or leaving the meeting. At first, I didn’t feel any shit , I was like whatever. Suddenly, Idk from where, this stupid ass voice kept on telling me why I should feel bad? It was really overwhelming. I wasn’t able to stop. I feel like I am being dramatic af and trying to pity myself. I’m not able to stop myself. Idk how to deal with it. These thoughts don’t even stop, I am not even kidding I feel I am going crazy. I don’t want to tell this to friends and parents but they either brush it off and tell me just to stop thinking. Sometimes I just want a car to hit me so it can be stopped.

Sorry for my English."
"Doctor's appointment for anxiety later today, what do I say?","Hi, so I finally decided that there's no way imma get through the next few months in the state I'm in, so I got a doctor's appointment for later today to get some help.

Anywayy, I have no idea what to say when I go in. Like ""what can I do for you today?"" Err, idk bro, I'm stressed af, having anxiety attacks, can't relax at all, constantly feel on edge about deadlines/my future/dumb shit I cant get out of my mind.

My mum said that I shouldn't down play my symptoms cuz therapists r in short supply atm but that made me feel like a fucking impostor. 

I really just need help w the first sentence to say, how do I start talking?"
I don’t even know,I was diagnosed with high functioning anxiety 7 years ago by some psychologist person thing I’m 14M and a few years later he lost his job for sending nudes to a patients mum and I haven’t really felt like I had anxiety until my brother has convinced me to talk to girls so I’m talking to someone who I like btw and she goes to my school and she also works with me but recently she told me while she was working apparently she saw the person who sexually assaulted her and when she told me my heart sunk and ever since then my stomach has felt hollow and I haven’t eaten that much and I just can’t think straight and I think it might be cause I’ve only talked to her for 4 days but I haven’t slept in over 30 hours and I don’t think it’s because the sexually assaulted thing it might because I haven’t really talked to girls like ever really and the only reason I mentioned the psychologist is because he might of false diagnosed me with high functioning anxiety and also he diagnosed me with high functioning but I just wanna know what you guys think about the situation. Also kids feel free to delete this post if it’s not related to anxiety
Anyone else get this?,"
I get these little head taps when trying to sleep and sometimes when i try go back to sleep after waking up in the middle of the night. My anxiety has been waking me up recently. It’s weird because it feels like i am seeing flashes occasionally but not at the same time it could be just my anxiety playing tricks on me and when i try go back to sleep I’ll get random thoughts that don’t make sense like i get this one thought of me turning off a switch and when i did that it woke me up with a jolt. It’s hard to say if i am seeing flashes or not or it’s just my anxiety. Sometimes i wake up in middle of the night and just turn over and my heart just starts beating out of my chest for no reason."
Long overdue papsmear tomorrow and scared.,"I have my papsmear tomorrow as well as the results to my bloodwork to check my hormones. Scared sh*tless that my pap is going to come back abnorm after having an irregular period out of nowhere last month (brown spotted for 7 days and bled moderately for 13 days). Thankfully my period was normal this month, but my health anxiety keeps telling me I'll have an abnormal smear (6 years past due) and have precancerous cells or cervical cancer. Ugh, I hate this. My health anxiety is through the roof. :("
Past Decisions Impacting Future,"Hi all. This has been something I’ve been struggling with for a while now and has been the catalyst for most of my anxiety. 

See a little while ago, I was scammed and blackmailed by someone who obtained a nude video of me. I managed the situation at the time and haven’t heard from the blackmailer since (I deleted all accounts that were linked to them) but they still have my full name and I worry that some day in the future, the video would be sent to my employer and it would lead to me being fired. 

I work as a software engineer so I can’t imagine it would actually lead me to be fired, it’s not like I’m a teacher, but it’s still a worry I have. I’m curious if any of you have any knowledge on the matter or have experienced something similar and have any advice. 

Thanks much

Also, if any of you could recommend a better suited subreddit, I’d appreciate it."
Hypochondriac having a panic attack,"Currently having a panic attack that’s lasted for about an hour already and there’s no end in sight. When most of your anxiety comes from the fear of dying, and panic attacks make you feel like you’re dying, it’s tough to get out of it. Keep me distracted please lol."
So here we go again not a great sleep and got 2 stressful things to deal with today then another stressful thing tomorrow.,"I can't cope with any stressor and I've got 3 in two days, I'm just gonna have to battle.my way through it as best as I can what else can I do well aside from the obvious harm or just give up completely. I dunno gotta try ain't I even when I don't feel quite right quite here quite present. Still gotta keep going."
How do you get yourself through a job interview?,"I would like to consider myself mildly okay at containing my anxiety at this point in my life, but interviews are the bane of my existence. I have an interview in 2 1/2 days and while I'm grateful it's not in person, I despise talking on the phone.

Regardless, how have you guys gotten through interviews? For some reason it's one of those extremely hated things where I feel like I'm gonna throw up or stop breathing, like it's very bad. My usual tricks don't really work because I'm surrounded in an environment where I want to run but can't. I guess I just never knew how to confidently talk about myself while being very very judged while doing it."
Tips on how not always to assume the worst?,"I am a current university student (I am also diagnosed with ADHD) so school is something that always stresses me out. I have a very challenging upcoming semester ahead of me and I’m ungodly nervous about it. I have talked with my therapist many times about how I have no reason to be afraid because I always do well in my classes in the past. But this feeling makes me wanna throw up. I always assume the worst in a lot of areas of my life (especially school) do to the fear of living the same life my parents did raising my siblings and I. We grew up in poverty and all my parents want me to do is not end up where they are. Any tips please? 

thank you."
Anxiety has increased since starting Zoloft again. I start a new job soon. What can I do?,"Hey all, my doctor prescribed me 50 mg of Zoloft a few days ago. I wanted to start medication again because in even somewhat uncomfortable situations my heart beat speeds up, I get nauseous, and I visibly shake. I’m currently on day three of the medication, and my anxiety has increased a lot, even in situations that I normally wouldn’t be anxious in. I’ve never had a full blown panic attack but I felt like I was going to have one just trying to watch a movie in public today. The day before I almost skipped lunch because the idea of talking to a drive thru cashier made me start shaking.

I’ve been on Zoloft before years ago. I think my doctor started me on 25 mg before moving me up to 100 and I didn’t feel any side effects ever.

I want to try and feel better as soon as possible, and I know the side effects can last a week or so. Should I lower to 25mg? That being said, I don’t want my original symptoms to come back either. Or would I benefit more from staying at 50.

I start a new job in a week and the idea of being a nauseous shaky mess makes me even more anxious."
Hi Reddit,"I have my first job interview in four years tomorrow (i lost mine after requesting to work remotely during the pandemic) 

I cannot sleep and am panicking. Tips?"
Need to rant,"A few days ago, my anxiety got the best of me and I went off on a friend while I was trying to conceal that I was having an attack. It made a bit of a scene and led to all the people we were hanging out with leaving.

Tonight I did the same thing. I was with the same group, and was getting completely ignored. Everytime I talked no one listened, or I was talked over. Even if it wasn’t intentional, it made me feel super shit about myself and I began to have a bit of an anxiety attack. I was trying my best to conceal it and was doing a pretty good job at it too. I don’t know why I even entered this situation in the first place, I had a gut feeling it would end like this. I felt like I was super fucking alone and didn’t want to leave because I was too scared they’d talk about me behind my back. 

I waited a solid 5 minutes trying to get a friend’s attention which just enhanced my anxiety and made me feel even shittier. As some of my friends motioned to leave, I got up to go with them, but they proceeded to sit back down, leaving me at the door. I then got ready to leave, but asked them if they were going to which apparently was a major fuck up. They just looked at me and got pissed and then I went off. All my bottled up anxiety came out and I hate myself for it. The friends I was with left with me and told me that I can’t keep doing this, but I don’t know how to stop this. I left them and know they went back to the group and talked about me for an hour straight.

I fucking hate myself for this right now. Just needed to rant and get this off my chest. I don’t know what to do anymore, this shit just keeps getting worse and worse and worse for me.

I’ve realized now too that I smoked the same shit on both of these nights. The first incident was the first time, the second time was last night where I almost had a panic attack but stopped it, the third time was tonight. I’m extraordinarily pissed at myself for not realizing this sooner, and even angrier that I didn’t know that certain types of weed can enhance your anxiety. I’m sorry for anyone who read all of this, I need to get this off of my chest, I hate this so much and it’s having such a god awful effect on my relationships. I burned a lot of bridges tonight and can’t keep this from happening. I don’t know what to do anymore man, I just don’t know what to do anymore."
Anyone ever freeze before they have to go somewhere?,Recently work has been getting me down because of a few reasons. Basically I’ve struggled with it mentally. Then one morning as I was getting ready I just couldn’t physically go in. It’s hard to explain but I just couldn’t drag myself in. When I didn’t go in the anxiety only got worse as I’ve had quite a bit of time off recently and I felt so guilty and worried about my career. I mean I hate work some times I find it so difficult to cope with at times. Other times i enjoy it. I am embarrased by the amount of time off I’ve had to have recently. Anyone else the same?
"If caffeine fuels anxiety, then what to do instead of it?","If caffeine fuels anxiety, then what to do instead of it?"
Overthinking,"Said something kinda invalidating of someone else’s experience, I think just trying to relate and find connection, but immediately regretted it . Not a close person in my life , but strong urge to apologize and correct myself . Wondering if it would be for me tho, and not for them.."
I fear of getting abducted by aliens,I'vee always been very skeptical about this alien stuff but my anxiety made me fear being abducted by a thing i dont even quite believe exists. Anyone also has this fear??
I made a phone call!,"I had to cancel an appointment and the only way to cancel was by calling. I kept postponing for days but today was the last day to do it, so I just decided to bite the bullet and made the call. It made me terrified, but the actual call lasted for less than a minute. I feel so great since I have never been able to do this before. I hope you also do something that makes you proud of yourself today! <3"

and i’m SO ANXIOUS. i kinda feel like i can’t breathe and i’m so shakey. i can’t stop stressing out.

pls can someone help reassure me or something? :("
Scared I’m pregnant even though I got my period. I’ll explain why,"So I’m an extremely paranoid person , I got this scared right after watching some tiktok videos about how some girls had regular heavy bleeding but still turned out pregnant even without knowing. Apparently it’s called cryptic pregnancy.
I just got sexually active early this year to my long term boyfriend. In terms of my periods , it can be irregular and light at times but other times it will come out fine. So my first scare was at the end of February when I lost my virginity to him and he came inside when I said no. This was feb 26th and it’s stupid I know and I took the plan b right after which was within 4 hours and we broke up. 
I was extremely paranoid but ended up getting my periods and everything was fine. Periods were regular. Took too many tests all came out fine. 

I didn’t have sex again until the 25th may with a current guy who I’ve been seeing since early April. He made sure I was comfortable and pulled out. I got my period the following month as well but it felt sorta light , so 2 weeks after I took a pregnancy test and it showed I wasn’t pregnant(this was June). However the month of July I didn’t get my period at all and this time took another test and still I wasn’t pregnant and also 25th may was the last time I had sex. Wayy too paranoid after that. So August I got my period TWICE which was the first week on of the month and it still felt light but then 3 and half weeks later I got my period again on the last 7 days of august and this time it was heavy which I felt relieved. (Maybe my July period was a week late hence why I had two periods in august ?)

Btw I’ve had irregular, light and heavy cycles before so it’s not that new but this new fear sucks. I’m due my next period any day now.  Like I said I haven’t had sex since may 25th It’s been ages so idk why I’m worried, these stories I’m seeing on tiktok is making me paranoid, I’m a petite frame but early this year my stomach did gain a bit (before I lost my virginity Btw) so sometimes I think what if it’s not fat but something in me and I just don’t know about it. I’m scared if it’s from may 25th I would be 15 weeks without knowing. And if the time I lost it at feb I would be 28 weeks without knowing. I’m seeing my doctor in 2 weeks when face to face dr appointments start again for the pill(country in lockdown). Please don’t judge me i know it was stupid to have unprotected sex twice, I should have learnt after the first scare. I’m not planning on have sex again until I get on the pill or even at all tbh.

Edit: got slight period like cramping and very lightly bleeding but not a full on period yet. I’m scared I’m hoping its a period"
Anxiety and being shirtless,"Hey all I’m a guy in my mid 20’s. How do you get over general/social anxiety and being shirtless around people?

I have one housemate (a girl around my age, we met a couple months ago). When I’m home alone I like to just chill shirtless, I sleep shirtless, fine swimming or being at the beach shirtless. But it’s getting warmer and I’d like to be more comfortable just being shirtless at home, or after a run or workout or whatever. Is that weird? How can I get more comfortable with that?"
Searching google and what do you know. “Sudden cardiac death can happy to all ages and can happen to otherwise healthy people” like wtf… now I’m anxious and can’t get over this. How do y’all deal with this? Is there any reassurance you guys know?,
Does anyone else’s anxiety get worse with movement ?,"I have anxiety pretty badly , I’ve noticed that every time I’m on the verge of a panic attack if I try to get up or walk across the room it gets severely worse, I usually have to lay down and do absolutely nothing"
Literally haven’t had a good week in a month…getting my wisdom teeth pulled made it all worse. My stomach can’t handle this🥺 my anxiety is through the roof.,
Can’t stop thinking,"Help please, my brain just keeps thinking and thinking about kind of awkward situations. Im watching Movies and shows to distract myself but right when I think of it again, my mind feels like I need to punch myself in the face. The situations I’m in are not even that bad too, like saying hi to my family members. I hate my mind and I suck at talking. Makes me angry sometimes to that I’m the way I am, lazy awkward,unmotivated fuck. Sorry for leading to venting, my mind is racing and this is some of it."
"Between the eternal pandemic and climate change, is there any hope life will ever be good?",I'm just so scared about the end of the world through everything that's happening with our climate. Is there any evidence the end isn't inevitable?
so nervous.,"I start work tomorrow first day at a new place tomorrow, I’ve had many jobs before just been out of work for awhile and I’m feeling super nervous and anxious not in a good way."
How do I get all the bad thoughts about the vaccine out of my head?,"My family is vehemently anti-vax, and keeps talking on and on about a lot of different things. They work healthcare and it makes me sick to my stomach honestly to even think about it. I'm probably going to have to take a Klonopin just typing this out honestly I'm incredibly scared to get the Vaccine.

This is ironic because I had my first dose in early August. Local store keeps calling me to go saying I'll have to restart my shots but a medical article I read said waiting between shots up to three months is more effective but they're saying if I didn't get the second shot end of August that it's ineffective entirely. I thought Canada had massive waits between shots too?

Couple with upping my dose of Lexapro and an eye issue that sort of but didn't resolve that I had happen right after my first shot (going blind in one eye, mostly resolved itself after a few weeks but can't see an eye doctor until October 30th)

I'm not sure what was side effects of the shot, what was from upping my dose, what was from my agoraphobia, what is just GAD, etc,. I'm genuinely freaking out but I'm terrified of getting COVID. I'm 6'5"", 260lbs, up almost forty pounds since starting treatment and I know if I get COVID I'll probably die. I have constant paranoia about being able to breath and I feel like I can't breathe even with my Oxygen being 99% (?). I know it's part of anxiety and panic attacks but the lump in my throat and dry mouth from the Lexapro don't help. I'm just not sure what to do. For the first time in months I was able to spend a few hours outside today before it got bad and I'm terrified of going to the store for my shot but I need to start working again and don't know how to find online jobs with just a HSD. I've been to the doc several times about the breathing they say I'm fine and I can't afford any more bills I can't even pay the medical bills I have they're going to collections and I'm at the point of selling all my studio gear to just pay them off but I've spent years building my collection/mic locker/camera gear. It's awful and I don't know what to do I'm sorry my thoughts are unorganized but I litert don't have anyone to talk to all my friends disappeared over the last few months due to various reasons so all the people I talk to to recharge and mentally feel better are gone and I feel like I'm going crazy in my house like I hate being stuck inside and have to change which room I sleep in every few days and can't even sleep in my bed at all so I'm just wondering what I should do about the vaccine to be able to go get a job and if I need to restart my schedule what all I have to do I don't even know if it's safe everyone says it's not and I'm terrified"
Clonazepam and alcohol,"I went to party today around 5 and drank some wine and a shot of tequila but it never got me feeling tipsy or anything and stopped drinking at around maybe 7:30-8pm and around 12 am I felt my self getting anxious so I took half of a 0.5mg of clonazepam which was prescribed to me for moments when I feel an anxiety attack coming. I’m just kind of paranoid as I saw online that it was extremely dangerous to mix alcohol with this medication, but I completely forgot I had drank alcohol today as I just felt my anxiety come and I went straight to take the clonazepam, is everything fine or should I be worried about mixing the 2 in this situation?"
Help please I don’t know how to make others understand,"Help—Idk how to explain to my boyfriend what it’s like to have social anxiety and depression.  He’s a social butterfly and can’t understand why I am the way I am.  He gets so frustrated with me.  

Tonight, we went to a wedding where he was one of the groomsman and I was not in the wedding party.  I knew little to no people at this party so I was very uncomfortable but did my best to look cheery and happy.  I worked so hard to look comfortable and happy despite being deeply uncomfortable.  I showed up to the wedding at 4 and made it through the ceremony maintaining my composure. But at around 8pm this whole situation started to become too much for me.  

We were seated at the wedding party table and both went to the bathroom and when he came out he didn’t wait for me. Instead he went to go and mingle with friends.  I got out of the bathroom and looked for him but he was no where to be found.  The wedding planner told me to take a seat so the first dance could begin.  

I was back at the table directly behind the couple doing their first dancing with the rest of the wedding party sans boyfriend.  At this point I’m freaking out, everyone at the table is canoodling with their significant other during this romantic song and I’m just there.  Alone.  Trying to make it look like I belong and am super happy because I’m gonna be in the background of all of their photos.  I don’t know these people, I met them 2 days ago.   I finally spot my boyfriend and he has just standing across the floor laughing with his friends as I wave to him to come back to sit and he just stands there laughing with him friends.

After the first dance, I took my purse to go sit inside and compose myself.  I’m on the verge of crying at how awkward I feel.  My boyfriend follows me in and is mad at me about going inside.  I ask him to please leave me alone so I can put myself together but he is getting progressively more and more frustrated with me.     He says my feelings don’t make sense and I continuously say that he can’t understand how I’m feeling but please have some empathy and  don’t get mad at me.  I ask him to please leave me and go rejoin the wedding because he will be missed.  I even try to say maybe we can talk about this in the morning because we have been drinking. I really don’t want to ruin this wedding.  I’m just feeling overwhelmed plus I don’t want everyone to know that I have debilitating anxiety.. He will not leave me alone, he is the kind of person who wants to fix things right there.  He says I’m not explaining how I’m feeling and why and at this point I’m straight up balling because he is getting very frustrated at me.  I have no idea what to do.  

I don’t know how to explain to someone that doesn’t understand what it’s like to have anxiety and he can’t tell when I’m about to go into full on panic mode.  I try to tell in the moment when I’m feeling uncomfortable but he just thinks i can “power through” and then when I can’t he makes me feel bad about leaving the situation and says that i’m ruining the party.  How can I make him understand?"

Does your Anxiety fluctuate at times and you don’t know what the trigger is?,"I have pretty severe social anxiety. But there are periods where I am Much better  in terms of the anxiety. I’m doing the same things and taking the same medication I have always. Not sure what it is that makes me feel awful most times but some times I have confident. I’m not doing anything different. It’s like the feeling of the honeymoon period on some psychiatric medications. That feeling, But I never started a new medication. Also is my anxiety in this case more mental or chemical imbalance based, in your opinion. 

Though Anyone else get this effect at times? As in anxiety fluctuating without a reason as to why."
Tips for freeway drive tommorow,"Hi guys I am currently super nervous because I am driving an hour away on the freeway to go to the neurologist for my agoraphobia and panic disorder. At least my dad is driving so it will be a little better but I feel it’s going to be really rough

I was wondering if anyone has any tips for calming down my thoughts while on the freeway.

I fear not having off ramps available in long stretches of road and traffic.

My biggest fear is that I will become stuck in traffic and start to panic without a way to get home. I am also afraid that when I’m about 40ish minutes out I will panic because I know it’s a long way to get home. 

I think a big part of me still believes that panic can last forever and can hurt me and I still struggle with the thoughts immensely. 

Any tips or words of advice would be appreciated cause I am really nervous right now.

Thanks!"
I hate when people tell me what I’m going through is normal,I’m currently struggling a lot with post grad anxiety since I graduate college in May. Everyone is like “that’s normal” and I’m just like that’s not fucking helpful of course I know that what I’m going through is normal
How do y’all deal with anxiety?,Hey guys ? I made a Reddit account in hopes of finding some advice for anxiety? How do y’all cope with it. It’s taken a toll on my mental health & body.
do y’all ever get those feelings of dread for no reason,"like i hear my name or something this just horrible feeling of dread and i gotta catch my breathe for a minute, idk could just be a me thing"
Visualization techniques only bring scary thoughts.,"Many of my therapists, psychiatrists, and favorite mental health resources have recommended visualization techniques to reduce my late-night anxiety that keeps me from going to sleep. However, whenever I start doing these exercises, my mind quickly goes to dark and scary thoughts, which can even cause panic attacks. What type of exercises can I try that don't require much mindfulness?"
Sore throat - contrast dye worried,"Hello,

I have written this a couple days ago but I'm still worried. So, I got the CAT scan (CT scan) with contrast  on Thursday noon. I developed hives over it on Thursday night, which the doc thinks it's a delayed adverse reaction. I took Zyrtec and it went away.

The only thing I'm worried right now is the allergy coming back (cause I've heard it can still happen after a week). My throat is still dry, and I feel like something is inside my throat (like a sore throat). This sore throat started happening on Saturday, and it has been continuing for the last 24-30 hours. I'm not sure if it's getting worse because it has been staying the same.

I'm worried if this is an early symptom of an anaphylactic shock that could cause me not to breathe suddenly. Anyone that can help me out here?"
Ate a restaurant!,"I went to a restaurant with some family a few weeks ago and ended up having such a huge panic attack that I hid in the toilets for the majority of the meal. I don't like to cause a scene and any kind of acknowledgement of a panic attack for me makes it much worse. So I just told the family that the food upset my stomach. 

I've had GAD for like 12 years now so I know I avoid certain places and situations if I have had a panic attack there before. So after being on my meds for about 5 weeks I thought it was time to try some exposure therapy. We booked the same restaurant and went to eat there....

I had a lovely meal, didn't have any panic throughout and really enjoyed the experience. Its a relief, and although it was terrifying to even go to the restaurant again, it's proof that I can do it. It's also a reminder that I will never come off my meds again, and that's it's okay if I need them to function, it's just like an iron deficiency.

I know it sounds so small, just to go to a restaurant, but if anyone would understand how great of an achievement that is, it would be you guys!"
mentally exhausted,"i’ve just been so mentally exhausted lately and just feel so defeated sometimes and just wonder when this low point is gonna get better. it’s been so hard and i try so many things to help it and none of them have been working cause that’s how bad it’s been. talking to people and listening to people is what helps me most, so feel free to share anything you want to share. i have hope for us all🤍"
loss of appetite,does anyone have any tips with how to deal with this? i’m really stressed right now and anxious about everything so i’m having a hard time trying to eat. i can barely even swallow oatmeal :( anything is appreciated 😊
Tapering,"Hi!
I’ve been on 1mg of clonazepam 1x a day, and a .5mg on an as needed basis for 15 years now. 

This medicine helped my agoraphobia and anxiety immensely up until a year or so ago. I guess it’s either not working anymore due to how long I’ve been on it or I need a higher dose…
I don’t want a higher dose and I honestly want to get off of this medicine. Kinda mad at myself for staying on a benzo for so long. 
I’m no longer agoraphobic but my anxiety is definitely still here. I’m sure it wouldn’t be as bad if my life wasn’t basically in shambles but ehh.. 

Any advice on tapering and/or other anti anxiety medicines that aren’t benzodiazepines?

Thanks 😊"
"Looking for advice, how to deal with anxiety stopping you from being productive","I have been sitting at home doing nothing for the past 6 years after i dropped out of highschool due to issues (16 back then, im 22 now) i didnt care back then because i was a kid and loved having no responsibilities and doing nothing but ive gotten to a point where all i can constantly think of is that im 22 and havent gotten anywhere in life yet and im getting scared for the future,  after years of being lazy i also built up an insane amount of anxiety , family offerd to pay for my scooter license since we live pretty deserted and scooters are a great way to get around where i live but i struggle to make myself even study and take the tests, let alone getting a job if i do manage to get the license, i remember getting an anxiety attack about 3 years ago while i was only thinking about getting a job and looking around, i spent the entire night crying not knowing what to do and it destroyed me mentally

It sickens myself that i havent gotten anywhere yet and that i am what i am right now, a part of me would love to get a job, get an income and socialize since i have been rather lonely for the past years and loneliness is what got me into a depression too, but im also scared and havent been able to make myself do anything even though i dont wanna continue living my life the way i have for the last few years

Any help is appreciated, would love to hear what helped you or someone you know if you had a similar issue"
My S/O isn't the best driver and it absolutely triggers my peak anxiety,"And right now I'm typing this to keep Myself distracted as it's a 45 min trip on the interstate with several bridges 
Idk if this is the right place to do this but I figured you'd understand. We went to Hollowscream tonight which was awesome! The scare actors truly are masters of their craft. I think it would be really cool to be one actually! Idk what kind of training you need or prior experience,  I would guess maybe some improv studies or acting background but maybe not! I think if I got the chance I'd be one in costume, something lanky and speedy lol 

The park itself was extremely immersive with the lighting and practical effects and absolutely has an otherworldly vibe. It'd best to experience everything at night time I think though, for obvious reasons. 

They didn't have many scare houses though I think 5 in total but they were all very well planned put and executed.
I couldn't help but admire the costumes and props when I was supposed to be getting the bejesus scared put of me! 
I've never been to Hollowscream before so I didn't know what to expect but I definitely wasn't disappointed and I wanna go back as soon as possible! 

People drive so damn fast on the interstate Holy shit 
So reckless 

This being my first ever spooky experience as an adult really makes me want to experience a tad more extreme haunts, something that can absolutely deny me the leisure or comfort of admiring the art behind it 
I've never really looked into it though, you got any recommendations?

There was this one place I heard of called McKammie manoror something like that where they were borderline torturing the participants, I dunno how into that I am lol just thought ot was note worthy 

Ughhhhjjjj she's going 40 in a 65 
Fuckfyckfuckfuck 
She doesn't take kindly to me saying anything about her driving and honestly it drives me insane it's just so fucking dangerous and I don't understand how she's totally ok with it, like Idk dude, of you aren't comfortable enough to make these trips them we shouldn't like it's fine ugh 

If I say anything though she will snap and drive even more careless 
Anyway shit 

Did you know that an elephant eats up to 100 fruits away while humans require 9?
I learned that at Busch Gardens 
Their massive dudes that's for sure 
We saw them tonight for a little bit 
I wo Der what the animals were thinking about Hollowscream hahaa 
Must've been pretty confusing 

There weren't many animals in their enclosures tonight for obvious reasons but the elephants were because where else could you keep tbem?!

As I was petting a Kangaroo last time we were there during the day I kind of got sad for the little animal dudes who live their whole lives at busch gardens 
Do you think they miss being free? Or were they maybe rescued? Idk 
Seeing the way they all just kind of Lounged made me wonder. 

How would you feel if you got everything you needed and wanted but couldn't leave a cage? Kind of a conflicting thought tbh lol 

Were finally getting off the interstate so imma wrap it 
Sorry to the Mods if this breaks rules and also any typos as it was just rapid fire but I hope it was at least read worthy as ot was definitely helpful 
Cheers"
i’m so freaked out right now.,"i have weird thoughts sometimes. and suffer from dpdr that i’m trying to recover from. and just a minute ago i just felt confused on where our words come from. like i said something and wondered how it came to mind for me to say it. and now everything i say feels weird because i dont understand where the thought comes from. and i’m wondering if i’m even in control of what i say. 
i’m sorry if this all sounds weird or confusing but i’m crying and freaking out just need some consolation please."
Working on Overcoming Negative Thinking/Ruminating,"Hey everyone, 

I hope everyone is doing alright. I wanted to gain a bit of a perspective on how I’ve been feeling. COVID has taken a bit of a mental tole, as it has for a lot of people. To sum it up, I was doing great during quarantine. Working from home, staying active, etc. I got to a point where my anxiety went through the roof. I ended up on Lexapro after consulting with a doctor and it left me worse off. I spiraled a bit and I feel as though I still have some PTSD from how it made me feel. I went off cold turkey and really found a good stride moving forward for a while.

Off and on, I’ve felt great and I’ve felt anxious. I’ve consulted with a therapist and even graduated from her program. Negative thinking has been my downfall and I really give myself a hard time, especially when I’m on a longer streak of doing well. I’ve found over the last month or so that I haven’t really been enjoying things as much as I used to. I tend to search and associate other’s mental health with my own and I think I might be generating a habit of being obsessive with how I can get better. 

I don’t think I’m depressed, I think that these negative thoughts loops are controlling my mood. Does anyone have a similar story or success story? I recently bought “Feeling Great” by David Burns. I’ve heard good things and I think the written CBT can help me.

Thanks in advance for any advice. I’m determined to get better, one day at a time."
Anxiety Sunday nights,"How do you all handle anxiety the night before a workday? My anxiety has gone up the roof, and I try to calm myself with some thoughts; but I feel like I’m really not doing well at work which causes my anxiety to shoot up during the weekends."
Shivering/trembling while speaking,"So I used to experience this rarely, but it happens pretty often now. When ever I talk to someone and am speaking constantly, for example telling a story, I begin to feel like my body is shivering. I’m not sure why it happens, and it’s difficult to speak without others noticing that my voice is shaking. Sometimes I don’t even feel nervous, yet it’ll still make me tremble/shake.

 I’m assuming it’s related to my anxiety, so I was wondering if anyone has dealt with this too."
Worrying way too much.,"I feel like 90 percent of the time, I’m worrying about something— something I said, did, the future, etc. My stomach always feels like it’s in knots and I’m never not overthinking. For example: just this past weekend, I hung out with a friend I hardly ever see. Her birthday is this week and I got her a gift (nothing much, just a fall candle and a t-shirt that reminded me of her that I thought was cute) and I can’t help but think it was dumb and I shouldn’t have given it to her. I keep on thinking that she probably doesn’t like it or I should’ve done something else. This is a perfect example of me worrying over nothing. I feel like the constant worry is ruining my life. My nerves are shot, I’m constantly worried about what others think and my appearance so I’m constantly down on myself. I can’t fall asleep at night and I’m having so much trouble focusing at work and on daily tasks. I procrastinate and I feel unaccomplished most of the time. I have had no desire to do much of anything lately, but I know for a fact that I need to get myself help."
Does anybody else feel like they have ME/CFS,"So fatigued all day everyday, can barely do the most basic tasks. I am bedbound most of the time due to this unrelenting fatigue and anxiety symptoms. Is anybody here in a similar situation?"
Does anyone take Trazodone for acute anxiety attacks?,"I was just prescribed Trazodone 50mg at bedtime for sleep. While it didn't make me tired, it did seem to calm me down. Does anyone take it as needed for anxiety? Does it work in the acute setting? Any info would be helpful. Tyia!"
Feel like I've lost control of my life,"I don't live I just exist. All my emotions feel fake and generated. I run from everything and I lie constantly. The worse thing is being so self aware but not knowing how to stop yourself. Anxiety is feels like my base line now, feels like I'm overthinking my self to death."
Driving alone anxiety?,"Hi, does anybody else have anxiety while driving alone? I get really anxious of even thinking of doing it, I did it only once and I got in the wrong road twice, whilst almosting hit a parked bus.
The thing is, if I have someone else on the car with me I'm okay, there's still the normal anxiety but it's manageable, driving solo makes me crazy though.
Did anyone find a way to get over this? I have no problem doing other things alone, in fact I prefer doing almost everything by myself, but driving alone is a strong no."
"Ate some chicken that tasted funny, currently panicking","I ordered chicken soup from my favorite pho place tonight. I noticed after a few bites that it tasted kind of off, but I ignored it at first thinking it was too much cilantro. Pretty soon I realized it was the chicken that tasted and smelled weird. I hadn't put all of it into the soup yet, and I tried to take out the pieces that were left in there and just eat the noodles and veggies. 

Now I'm wondering why I didn't just toss the whole thing. I ate some of that chicken and drank the broth it was in. I'm so scared I'm going to get food poisoning that I actually tried to make myself sick earlier. I've always had issues with health anxiety. 

Has anyone been through this? Did it end up being okay? I'm so afraid."
How did you know you needed medication?,"Forgive me if you saw me post yesterday

I am strongly considering talking to my doctor about starting Paxil again after weaning off last summer after being on it for 6 years. 

Yesterday was rough. Couldn't get out of bed, worrying about the future, stomach aches, no motivation to finish school work I desperately had to do, pounding headaches from crying. Finally got up at 3 pm, tried to do Doordash to make some money. Drove about a mile, felt my chronic illness start to flare (which I'm convinced anxiety is a major cause of it), turned around and went home. Made no money just wasted gas. 

Today I feel okay, maybe even good. Successfully did a few Doordash orders, now working on homework, albeit a bit hard to focus. 

Yesterday I felt 100% I needed Paxil. I have an old bottle of 10mg pills I was tempted to take (I used to take 40 mg everyday). Today, not so much. 

It makes me question myself and if I really need to go back on. 

How did you know it was time to talk to your doctor?"
Weed caused pounding and fast heart beat feel like a panic attack,"Side note I don’t smoke weed at all esp now

One night I had smoked weed and I started to feel hot my blood pressure went up and my heart started to beat really fast so I had to go to the emergency room they had to put me on IV to get the weed or high out my system

Ever since then I have been having random panic attacks out of no where where my heart start beating fast like pounding like crazy and I literally don’t be doing much like I don’t be excercising or anything it starts beating fast out of nowhere 

 I had put on a heart monitor and the cardiologist had got the results back and said that I have slight arrhythmia 

For example when I take a shower especially at night my heart starts racing and I start to hyperventilate and have panic attacks 
 
Anyone else experience this any advice ???"
Is it just me who just feels weird in certain settings,"I can't explain the feeling I just feel so anxious and the vibes just feel so wrong I hate that word I mean the atmosphere feels so wrong in some places I am in, for example I hate big cities they make me feel so weird and like pubs ( in the UK ) I hate they make me feel so weird, but I love places like the library and I love some hotel lobbies for some reason and I love old styles places and castles but I hate hate hate places like train stations and stuff idk some places just make me feel so so weird like I almost cried cus I was in a city late at night with family and I just felt so like uncomfortable"
"Can fear cause loss of attraction and feeling ""in love""?","Me (F28), him (M29).

Tl;dr Can deep fear of loss cause us to lose attraction to our partner, feelings of being in love, etc., even cause aversion or repulsion? 
And can it be remedied, healed, and can your feelings return?

I experienced going from ""in love"" to repulsion and an inability to even be around him as I deal with deep, old trauma.

Thankyou for any insight🙏"
Extreme social anxiety - lying to fit in - need help,"I am in my late 20s and always had a lot of social anxiety. As a result I lied a lot to fit in. I lied that I went to a public school instead of a private school, I never said my brother did a phd, or that my parents are business owners. Also never told some people i had a sister. All of this because I am afraid of being judged as wealthy and also did not want any sister jokes that guys so. Also I never said a lot of other things about my self.

I always feel really uncomfortable sharing any details about myself for people possibly judging me  as wealthy. 

Now I am scared if i start telling the truth people will be mad at me for having not shared these things with them before.

Anyone have any advice?"
Are these panic attacks?,"I’ve had anxiety for a few years but these past couple of months are the worst it’s ever been. One night I was just sitting there and was hit with a wave of dread/ fear - then what followed was a racing heart, trembling arms/ legs, cold sweats, and what I can only describe as feeling like I’m falling. I managed to calm down in the following minutes but ever since then I’ve been getting these random attacks on and off, which of course is only making my general anxiety worse, which only leads to overthinking and more of these episodes. I’m on the fence about whether or not these can be classified as panic attacks, as they don’t seem as severe as other people on here are describing (I have no chest pain, hyperventilation, feeling like I’m dying, the works). Could these be considered panic attacks?"
I posted a while ago that I was afraid of getting the vaccine.,"https://old.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/p1zn7b/too_scared_to_get_vaccinated/

I actually got my first vaccine this morning. I was meant to go to a doctor to just a chat over concerns. I told the doctor my concerns, then she had a chat with Mum and said it was better to get it over and done with today. It didn't really hurt and I feel OK afterwards."
I’ve begun to notice how hard it’s become to battle anxiety day after day.,"I just need to get some thoughts out. To preface, I’m not saying these things with anger or because I want people to feel bad. These are just thoughts I’ve been having lately while going on my anxiety journey:

Anxiety is extremely hard to battle. Almost every day is mentally rough. The negative, sometimes suicidal, what-if, and self-harm thoughts are sometimes relentless. The suffering in silence makes me feel unworthy of love, grace, support, and care, because sometimes I choose to do so. Not all the time, but sometimes. The fake smiling, joking, and laughing are things that I do to hide my anxiety because I wish people understood, but they don’t so I shouldn’t talk about it. The pressure of trying to be perfect is exhausting some days, both mentally and physically. Yet I hide my anxiety due to fear of becoming vulnerable, and possibly being judged.

I don’t like feeling like everyone is constantly judging me, or that I worry that I’ll do something stupid in front of people. Panic attacks make me feel like I don’t deserve love. Anxiety is not just worrying. It is so much more."
What helps you?,"So ever since I witnessed 2 family members go thru heart attacks. I have started this irrational fear of having one myself. Being 26 and having lost weight I know I'm healthy. Deep down I do know it. The Dr tells me I am and gives me medicine to help the anxiety. But I can't take the medicine because the first thing I do is google symptoms and freak myself out. I hardly eat anymore because I think it's gonna kill me. I set myself into panic attacks where I check my pulse and convince myself that it's not normal. I know at this point I'm sick but idk who to turn to. My family just laughs and says it's all in my head. And I know that. But here I am. Making my first post on Reddit after 2 years of dealing with this. Idk how to stop myself from being afraid to eat, from checking my pulse constantly, or pinching my skin to see if it's numb on my arm. Im just tired or the constant fear."
Unable to deal with big decisions. Does anyone else experience this and have any tips?,"This week I had to decide whether to sign for a new house I was looking to buy with my partner. I wasn’t too confident and my anxiety makes me uncomfortable with uncertainty so I would question everything about the place and the location and the price etc. 

It got to crunch time where I had to make a decision, my brain was telling me yes this ticks the boxes let’s just do it, but whenever I’d try and sit with that decision for even 5mins I’d have a total internal breakdown feeling nervous and scared and anxious. 

It got so bad I eventually had to say no not because I wanted to but because I was scared for my health and couldn’t live like that anymore.  

I feel sad we didn’t get the house now. This isn’t the first time I’ve been crushed by a big decision, it’s happened before when I was trying to pick whether to take a new job or not. 

I talk with my therapist about this, and they usually try to get me to listen to my gut and intuition but this absolutely doesn’t work for me. I’m so riddled with terrible anxiety that my gut just wants to pick the easy option out - in this case not buying the home. I think I might need to get on medication to help me through, but my anxiety is normally very manageable. Does anybody else experience this?"
Long term Lorazepam use,I’ve been on low dose lorazepam since 2007. My prescription is as needed. Anxiety is my thing. I was also recommended anti depressants as a way to calm my anxiety. Lexapro( big no)- I had the body tremors. Trentellix- not bad. Is just rolling with lorazepam ok?
Wondering What On Earth Is Going On With Me (and if anyone else feels the same),"hi! first time using reddit here.

I just wanted to share a bit of what goes on in my mind and see if anyone else relates because I try to google what might be going on with me but nothing feels 100% right.

My mind is always overthinking. I didn't even realize it until people starting calling me funny whenever I described my thought process. That also made me realize how much of a pessimist I am.

In most areas of my life, I'm perfectly fine. But when it comes to relationships and work, I get extremely stressed out to the point of spiraling. It could be mild, but other times it gets so intense that I'm unable to stay present and get really distant or the only way to make it stop is sleep. As I've recognized this pattern, it's gotten worse. A few days ago, I literally had to force myself to sleep to prevent myself from killing myself.

But this is the weird part, all of these spirals only last a couple days tops. And when they're over, either feel like I'm on cloud nine or stable but that's also only for a couple days tops. Sometimes the being distant thing goes on for a few weeks but that's it. Most of the time I feel like I'm living in a state where I'm neither happy nor sad nor empty, just cautiously living. I'm just so confused because all the anxiety and depression disorders seem to be constant but it's not for me, but when I am experiencing feels WAY too intense to be ""sadness"".

I should also mention that I can never be productive for more than a couple days. I'm either procrastinating and practically making myself think about anything other than what I should be doing. OR crunching because I'm mega stressed about the fact I should be doing something productive. Sometimes I'll even be stressed and still procrastinate.

I know that was a lot but I gotta know if anyone else relates or has any advice. Any thoughts are greatly appreciated."
Struggle on a night,Does anyone really struggle on a night? It’s currently 1:53am and I have to get up at 7am to take my step children to school but I can’t sleep. I’m extremely anxious. I’m struggling to settle and struggling even more to sleep. I feel so lonely.
Paramedics just left my house,"So, It’s been 6 months since I had a bad episode. And this past week has been the best week ever.  I did not experienced anxiety at all and was almost believing that I won my fight. And today while watching an episode of my favorite show. I felt like a stab on my chest and my heart just wen crazy beating supper fast and I lost it. I went into panic mode and thought I was dying. Scared my DH and told him to call 911. Now I feel super guilty for putting my family through this drama. On the other side I am happy that I am not dying."
"undiagnosed, this last week has been an absolute nightmare","i’ve never been particularly anxious but ever since i started my second year of uni and still being confused about my future has been so stressful. i can barely sleep into 6am, i’m constantly overthinking, my heart rate is extremely fast and my nicotine dependency is coming back. i’ve also been crying over the dumbest things for the last 3 nights and it goes on for hours. i got fired from my job yesterday and that was the icing on the cake for me, i’ve been in a constant state of panic and fear even though i was able to snag another job within a day. now im terrified about this new one— i’ve already lost a minimum wage job so i feel like a major loser, what happens if i lose this one too? what if i can’t keep up with the hours and balance school? what if i do poorly in school? does anyone have any advice on how to deal with these new emotions? im so scared"

Please I just need an advice,"For the past 4 months my life been full of anxiety and depression and stress since my dog passed away. Last Sunday I thought I had a heart attack while I was at my mothers house, but apparently it turned out and anxiety attack. I have never experienced anything like this before my heart was racing I felt my arms and my legs tingling and numb I was shacking uncontrollably. After going to ER they got my blood work and X-ray and EKG they didn’t find anything wrong. I went back home and I felt the same way again. After 3 days my stomach started to hurt me a lot like everything I eat and doesn’t digest well and I have a gassy stomach and my throat or esophagus burns. I also have a darker spots on my stool but I take Iron supplements so I associate it with that and I also get externe cramps and my life side below my rips it hurts so bad when I touch it. I get scared when I go places now thinking the anxiety attack will happen again. What should I do I’m always scared that I have something or a health issues every time I feel something I freak out and I start googling stuff to see if what I’m feeling is normal. I just need an advice idk what to do. I’m always in fear about my health I feel like I have some many diseases and cancers in my body and I can’t stop thinking about it. I also had excessive thirst and I am peeing every 5 mins for some weird reason."
advice on anxiety medication,"I hope this doesn't go against the rules. I'll delete it if so. Also TW for anxiety, panic disorder, medication, panic attacks and talk of death. 

For a bit of back story, I've had anxiety since I was 5 years old and was left alone. My anxiety of the jump was panic attacks and less of day-to-day anxiety. Also, my trigger is usually thinking that I'll die. More specifically not having any control over my thoughts anymore and less of physical death. (I'm not trying to get into religion or anything but my thoughts on the afterlife are kind of just ur dead and have no control over anything mentally or physically.) Last year, I had a really bad panic attack one of the worst I've ever had and ended up going to the doctor a couple of days afterward to talk about it. I did get prescribed a  small dose (like 2 or 3 pills) of anxiety meds. (I'm not sure what exactly. ) It was kind of just a last resort thing if no one could control my panic attack. However, I only got the meds because I asked for it and therapy was pushed heavily. My dad kept the prescription and I was told I had to ask him for it. I haven't taken it at all but there were a couple of times I wanted to ask for it. I've talked to him about wanting to keep control over it and take it if I see fit instead of asking him and it would give me a lot of peace of mind. He said he didn't have an issue with it, just that I've never had the pill before and he wants someone around the first time I take it in case I have a bad reaction. That was a few months ago and we haven't really talked about it since. Well, these past few months my anxiety has less and less been about panic attacks where it's now more of day-to-day anxiety. It's been really bad lately. I really want to go on a medication that I take daily because I don't think a pill that will calm me down in a panic attack is helpful as I'm not really having panic attacks. Also, with the therapy thing, I did talk to my uncle who is a professional therapist in the states but I didn't talk to him too much because he was family and I didn't talk with him too frequently. It was more just to get my dad off my back about talking to someone. I am now open to having a therapist I just didn't want it over the phone or zoom I need face-to-face interaction and covid and now school has been in the way a bit. However, it's really annoying me that whenever I talk about wanting to go on medication everyone says therapy first because I've always known my triggers, the cause of my anxiety and how to calm myself down in a panic attack. I get the intentions are pure but for the longest time, I was dead set against getting a therapist cause I had a bad experience when I was younger. So saying I want one now is a big deal for me, but I don't want it to be I can go on medication only if I talk to someone first. 

Does anyone have any advice? How should I ask for medication without firstly getting therapy? 

Thank uuu xx"
Fake Xanax vs real?,How can I tell if my Xanax is fake and not Medical grade?
Why do I get anxiety about people’s responses?,"Somehow this happens with almost everyone I know. It’s usually about how much time they take to respond. For example if they take more than three to four hours to respond, I get anxiety and think they don’t like me anymore. Or if they just don’t respond at all I get worried. I just overthink their responses all the time, I don’t know why. Even if they do respond I think about how they responded and whether it was dry or not. This usually happens more often with online friends, but it even happens with my irl friends. I hate that I have this. I’m sick and tired of being anxious about my friend’s responses all the time when it’s most likely nothing. When people do reply after me overthinking and practically killing myself over it, I get this small high if dopamine. I wait a little to respond and to me, the notification of the text looks so satisfying to me, so I have this thing where I wait to respond so I won’t seem weird. Even when I’m busy doing things, I’m still thinking about the responses. I noticed it’s gotten worse during COVID too. Pre-COVID, I wouldn’t overthink responses nor care whether people even responded to me or not. Now that I’ve been on my phone and other gadgets more often with COVID, I’ve gotten worse with overthinking responses. I hate that I have. I just want to go back to when I didn’t care about whether people really responded or not. I miss that. How do I go back to that?"
I need a hug 😢,Can I get a hug pls 🥺
Anxiety about… everything,"Hello, friends. Many of you guys have seen me constantly posting here. A lot of anxiety is driving me crazy and being here and sharing how I feel with people who go through the same, makes me feel safe.

I just checked up my blood sugar and the reader gave me a wrong reading of 42, then the correct one which was 86. Lately i’m getting anxious in anything health related (pills, illness, etc.) when I saw the 42 I started sweating, getting dizzy, and literally ran to my mother.

Oh, and I also had an anxiety attack that made me stop today at a hospital (my biggest phobia is hospitals and needles) lucky me the doctor checked me up (no needles needed) and gave me something for the anxiety.

Anybody on the same boat with anxiety spiking up suddenly?"
Separating self from mental illness?,"I realize that this is an odd question, but I've been doing some soul-searching lately. Specifically when it comes to my self in relation to my depression and anxiety. I apologize If I'm overthinking this. 

I try and recognize the intrusive thoughts as a separate entity and depression as something happening to me. However, it doesn't seem that clear-cut. I realize that the internal dialogue is a different voice from the real me, but at the same time I also feel like to some extent these thoughts are part of me. 

Sometimes I sort of feel like there's a possibility that these thoughts are just what I want to do or say. When I'm talking to people I care about and I can hear my brain yelling spiteful or violent comments, but maybe that's just how I truly feel? Maybe I'm actually super cynical, angry and pretty unpleasant. My actions don't reflect that, but possibly I'm acting how I think I'm supposed to, rather than just being me. Maybe we're all naturally violent or hateful but norms and values keep this at bay? 

Maybe I exhaustively think about this because I care, but at the same time this internal conflict keeps going. Like I'm split in two. I can't decide which me is actually me.  All I know is that I've dug myself into a bit of a hole."
Hi guys I just need an advice,"For the past 4 months my life been full of anxiety and depression and stress since my dog passed away. Last Sunday I thought I had a heart attack while I was at my mothers house, but apparently it turned out and anxiety attack. I have never experienced anything like this before my heart was racing I felt my arms and my legs tingling and numb I was shacking uncontrollably. After going to ER they got my blood work and X-ray and EKG they didn’t find anything wrong. I went back home and I felt the same way again. After 3 days my stomach started to hurt me a lot like everything I eat and doesn’t digest well and I have a gassy stomach and my throat or esophagus burns. I also have a darker spots on my stool but I take Iron supplements so I associate it with that and I also get externe cramps and my life side below my rips it hurts so bad when I touch it. I get scared when I go places now thinking the anxiety attack will happen again. What should I do I’m always scared that I have something or a health issues every time I feel something I freak out and I start googling stuff to see if what I’m feeling is normal. I just need an advice idk what to do. I’m always in fear about my health I feel like I have some many diseases and cancers in my body and I can’t stop thinking about it."
How common is it to not know exactly what causes your anxiety?,"I have a dentist appointment in a few days and its been causing me SO much stress. I've been having issues falling and staying asleep, all my dreams are dental nightmares, my memory is horrible to the point where I can't recall the previous day and often think IRL events were dreamt up. My eating habits are fucked too, I'll either go too long without an appetite, or I'll binge to the point of pain and nausea without really realizing it.

Heres the problem though. The dentist is SUPER nice, I'm only getting a single cavity filled, I'm not scared of the numbing needle, and I dont have any issue with metal in my mouth. 

I truly don't have any of the generic dentist fears of like gagging, or fingers in mouth, or numbing needles, or whatver it is. 

I'm barely living from anxiety but I don't fear the dentist and I dont know what the fuck is causing this anxiety. I know its 100% this appointment causing me anxiety, but  theres nothing about the appointment that's logically scary to me... So like wtf?"
Work anxiety,How do you guys cope with your anxiety when starting a new job? It's paralyzing and so draining.
Sleep anxiety ?,Does anyone else get scared to sleep. Not because I’m scared of dying in my sleep or terrible things happening but the thought that I will have to wake up and do everything again the next day. It makes me sometimes unable to sleep unless I’m really tired and then the next day I feel even more shitty. It’s like I’m trying to stop time because when you sleep it feels like time just speeds up ? Idk I just hate the thought of waking up the next day mainly on school days or sometimes weekends because I don’t want to waste the only time I have so I stay up late and can’t sleep
I am struggling with anxiety and self harming/suicidal thoughts,"If you come across this post please, I beg you, read until the end.

Hello, yesterday I broke up with my boyfriend who I also consider my bestfriend. My life is not going very well at the moment and I feel like this was kinda the last straw. He told me he has some problems with his mental health and feels like he needs some time to himself. He says that if he can not care for me (because of the state he is in) then there's no point in staying together. To give some context we started as fuck buddies right after he broke up with his ex and then got into a serious relationship but have never said ""I love you"" to each other. He told me that he is feeling insecure about our relationship because of this as well. I feel like I am not enough for him even though I am putting my heart into this relationship. I feel so insecure because he loved his ex so much... I often ask myself what do I not have that she does? I admit that I am not a very easy person to deal with since I come from a past of emotional trauma and abuse and feel unconforable doing various things like complimenting him and saying he looks cute and so on. This and some other behaviors bother him but are not the cause of the way he is feeling. I am feeling very overwhelmed by this whole situation given the fact that I do not have a job and my family is really struggling financially. I've been finding myself having thoughts about self harm and have had various anxiety attacks where I feel like I have a huge weight on my chest and can't breathe or breathe rapidly. I have not eaten anything in 2 days and I feel like if I were to eat I would throw up.
To top it all off he also said that he was scared to break up with me because of my current suicidal thoughts. When he said this I felt horrible, I felt that even without meaning it I've been manipulating him. I feel horrible, I don't know what to do but I know for a fact that I can't go on like this. He is the only joy in my life and I think that if I were to actually lose him I wouldn't be able to cope.He told me to give him some time but I don't know if I can hold on that long. I feel like I've lost a piece of my heart. I wrote this on a whim since I don't have any friends apart from my boyfriend. Leaving aside this situation I also can't find a job because there aren't any where I'm leaving and can't afford university. I don't know what to do with my life I feel like I don't have any perspectives. All I am thinking about in the last two days are dark thoughts about how maybe harming myself will alleviate this pain which I know it won't but it seems like I can't think rationally right now."
Help needed,Is it anxiety if I feel uncomfortable with an upset stomach when I sit down to chill with my friends. We normally play poker and drink. Now I just can't stand alcohol as it makes my situation worse. My immediate response is to leave them and escape.
How Can I get my doctor to prescribe me Xanax?,"My GP will only prescribe Busparizone, which I suspect has been giving me bad dreams. She won't prescribe anything with soft effects because of the Opioid epidemic. I am frustrated because I used to be a proponent of CBD but I started having bad feelings after taking too much."
Anxiety made me miss the last year of my papas life.,"My papa caught COVID and passed away on his 9th day being symptomatic. August 29th, 2021. 

Rewind to 2020…I had a miscarriage and developed an extreme panic disorder that made me go though extensive DBT therapy, lots of med trials and individual therapy. This anxiety caused me to be almost completely house ridden. I had to quit my job, I was luckily doing school online so that was my only outlet. Panic attacks were almost daily. Over the last year (March 2020-March 2021) I saw my grandparents MAYBE 10/20 times. They live 20 mins away. 

Almost every time I went over I was anxious and always rushing to get home. I didn’t mean to be. My papa was my best friend. The last time I saw him, we went to pick out shoes together. When I was heading back to his house, he requested that we go out to lunch. I didn’t want to, but I didn’t tell him that. I said “ok let’s go pick up grandma”. So we went to their house, asked if she wanted lunch and she replied, “I already ate.” He was kind of upset. I said that I had to do some things and that I needed to leave but he was disappointed. So, I said, you know what, those things can wait. Let’s go! So we went. He has dementia so I doubt he remembered that conversation, but I do. I hope he knew that I liked him. I hope he knew that I loved him. I hope he knew that he was my best friend. We went on that lunch date August 9th. He passed away 20 days later. 

The point of this post is that I feel that I missed out on so much time I could have spent with him.  I regret not going over there more often. I am ashamed that my anxiety took such a strong hold onto my life. I am so lucky that I got to spend time alone with him the last time I saw him. I am grateful that I have had 25 years with him. I just miss him so fucking much and I wish COVID didn’t have to take him away. He deserved better than a covid death. He took his last breath in the hospital, with my mother holding him. Maybe it is a blessing. I will say, that with his dementia getting pretty bad, he never forgot us. 

I just want him to know that I will never forget him. I think about him EVERYDAY. I just wish I could have one more moment with him. He was my best friend. And will always be my best friend."
"Afraid I’m gonna get fired, my anxiety is back in it’s worst form","I was hospitalized last week, took a cbd supplement that was laced with THC without my knowledge. I react very poorly to edible thc. I ended up in the hospital with Supra ventricular tachycardia and extreme paranoia, numbness, and dizziness and shortness of breath. I missed work the day after and left work early the day after that. Now I feel so panicky, anxious, and I’ll I don’t even think I can go in tomorrow. I’m a vet tech so I have to be “on” and alert at work and I’m not at all. I haven’t been sleeping. 

I can tell my boss was annoyed I left early on Friday. I can’t really tell her the reason I’ve been out cause it sounds like I got stoned and just decided to miss work. The product was purchased from a store marketed by the associate as CBD. 

I’m having constant panic attacks and depersonalization episodes from the trauma of the experience. I had come so far in healing from anxiety now I’m back at square 1. I’m crushed"
Need some advice.,"So I (30M) wrote in some other subreddits about my experience in trauma  bonding relationship with a psychiatry resident. I’ve been out of the  relationship for several months and am taking anti depressants and going  to therapy; which is how I leaned about trauma bonding. I’ve been  getting slowly better but I still think about her. And I try not to. I  almost feel like I’m in  a competition with her and myself to get myself  healthy again and find someone new. I’ve been told to hold off on  dating again till I heal more which I am. I guess I put all my  trust in  her and her being a doctor in training and having her do all this to me  has made me question everything and everyone and I really don’t trust  anyone anymore or myself. And I don’t want to hurt any new girl that  might come into my life. I don’t know what to do some days, I feel  broken still and other days I feel fine. I hate it, I want to be normal  again but I can never forgot what happened. I have anxiety about meeting  new women and comparing them to her. Some days I just break down and  cry because I’m mad at myself for being with her and mad at her for  making me this way. If anyone has any advice or guidance I’d appreciate  it."
What to do when Hydroxyzine makes you groggy in the morning?,"So I’ve never been a good sleeper. When I was younger I got a sleep study done that showed I have restless leg syndrome so I wake up a lot. I have a really hard time falling asleep now, a lot of that is attributed to my anxiety. My doctor prescribed me hydroxyzine to help with my anxiety and insomnia. The issue is whenever I take it, I cannot wake up in the morning. I feel exhausted and the other day I slept for 12 hours. Has anyone else experienced this? What did you do to help it? should I just take it way earlier?"
Leg cramps?,"Hello! I’m a 20 year old female. I have severe social anxiety. I went shopping for about an hour or so today and got anxiety while being out. I noticed that my legs get incredibly shaky and sometimes hurt during an anxiety attack. I still currently have lingering calf muscle pain in my left leg and sometimes pain in my right leg. I have a tendency to overthink about my health as well, so I am worried that I have a blood clot or something crazier happening besides just a sore calf muscle. Has anyone had lingering pain in their calf muscles from anxiety? It really worries me because i’m also on Nexplanon, the birth control implant and I just had a new one inserted about 3 days ago. Birth control has those risk factors of blood clots, and it really as me worried. If anybody can relate to lingering muscle cramping in their lower legs, please feel free to respond. Also, if anybody has any tips on how to relieve this particular calf pain, I would appreciate it as well. I already took a magnesium and D3 vitamin that is said to help muscle cramps. Thank you!"

"Burnout, restlessness, frustration?","I was just wondering how people ""turn it off"" effectively, and if there is such a thing, and how to do it. 

I'm in my first year of university, just broke it off with someone I was seeing, and am overwhelmed with financial burdens and challenges. 

I know it's really important to blow off steam, to ""turn it off"", to relax in different ways but for me my tried and true methods don't even work anymore. 

I used to game, lift weights, smoke, drink, enjoy a movie or TV show, or jump into a cold shower - I always had these things I could do to make myself ""turn it off"". Whatever it was I was made uneasy by I could relax into the normalcy of these pass times. 

I think a lot of it may be heightened due to finally returning to my education and remote learning and  being able to do work anywhere anytime continuously also puts pressure on you anywhere anytime that you should be working. Covid makes your house life and your school life inseparable. 

I haven't been able to turn it off or enjoy things or find peace for a long time, and even those things that I build up in my head as these sure-fire go to's whenever I wanna feel okay don't work. 

Is it something physical? Is the stress too much for my regular practices? Am I doing something wrong? Why do the things I used to do to blow of steam not work anymore, and what can I do in their place? 

Thx"
Puzzles,"I recently get a puzzle box from Barnes & Nobles (I'd post a video of it but unfortunately this sub doesn't allow those type of posts) and it's been very helpful during stressful moments. Obviously I'm not sure how effective it would be during a full blown panic attack, but it helped during the day to keep my mind off the stupid little things that I tend to turn into major reasons to start to panic. It's a nice little box that folds into different shapes and it makes a very satisfying noise when it locks into place. I also got a tiny game remote with a bunch of buttons, a joystick, and some other little trinkets that you can fidget with. I def reccomend finding a little trinket you can fidget with to carry with you throughout your day, it helped me a lot and I'm glad I found this :) hope it helps someone else"
I can’t stop feeling anxious about a selfie I sent to a random stranger,"A random person added me on Snapchat earlier today. Almost immediately, they asked to see what I look like. I had them snap me first to make sure they were who they said they were, and then I snapped them with a selfie of my face. Then I realized snaps can be faked, they may not be who they seem, and I’m spiraling out of control because I may have just sent a pic of myself to a random weirdo. I’m a minor which makes it bad."
Hello I need some advice on what to do in this situation?,"Basically its been almost 4 weeks since we have been back in school since the summer holidays and I have hardly done any of the work for one of my subjects and I barely know the teachers so I'm really anxious and nervous to go up to them and tell them  my reasons.

And I really don't want to get kicked out of the 6th form I go to for not completing my work.

So I'm thinking of telling my problems to this other perosn who is not a teacher of mine for that subject but he is like the assistant head of house  for the 6th form I  go to and I've had him as a teacher before so I'm more comfortable telling him my problems.

Basically my reason for not doing the work is bascially a close family member of mine who I loved  very much died during the holidays and I thought that I could just go back to school and do my work and just be like I was before the holidays and before this family member died but it as turned out to be harder than I thought going back to school acting like nothing happened or acting like I'm fine or that I can still do my work.

And I also have some other personal problems that have affected me and my capabilities in doing my work but that family member dying is one if the biggest things that have affected my work quality.

Idk. What do you guys think I should do."
Has anyone with anxiety overcome the fear of asking employers for references ?,"I have the nagging sense that I might have to ask an old employer for something. I have so much anxiety about asking for references, or following up with past employers, especially ones which I did not end things with perfectly. Advice ?"
Anxiety/depression meds help,"Hello,

I am not sure if I should post this question here but here it goes. I have had anxiety since college but this month has been terrible. I am constantly anxious and emotional. It is interfering with my daily life. I am irritable as well and get angry very quickly. I think I have every psych condition I read about and it is making it even worse. My psychiatrist put me on buspar which is some what keeping the anxiety down but its still very much there. He tried to put me on wellbutrin since it has worked for me in the past but I stopped taking it once I found out I was pregnant. However this time around it made me even more anxious and I stopped taking it after three days. I know the next logical step is an SSRI. I am worried about the sexual side effects but honestly the anxiety has made my libido non existent at the moment. I am thinking that I will feel like this forever and that is such a horrible feeling. Any advice?"
Does anyone feel their hands lighter when they get anxious?,"I don’t really know how to explain it, it’s like you don’t feel your hands but you actually do. They just feel lighter than usual, not numb. I can do things normally with my hands but they feel like feathers if that makes sense. I really dont know how to explain it better than this"
Advice for not always getting anxisty at places I usually do,"Hey guys! I am I’m on the back end of a big anxiety stint (thank god). Though I am still avoiding places where I have had anxiety attacks, for example I have some streets I don’t drive down any more, I am still frightened to walk on the beach for a long period of time and now I’m beginning to have anxiety when I am going on my morning jog.

The beach and the streets don’t bother me, as I’m not a beach person and I can drive other ways to work. I am just really disappointed now I feel it when on my morning run. I love running, it clears my head and makes me feel really good and is my way of keeping in shape. I have attributed the anxiety to sensory overload when I’m running, there is usually a lot of people around, a lot of noises and smells. I do not suffer social anxiety though *** 

I see a psychologist and she has said to feel the thoughts that come in my head and say reassuring statements, to ground myself by focusing on my feet hitting the ground as I run. I find this all too overwhelming and usually end up calling someone as my escape route (this always makes me feel better).

I need some advice on what I can do, I don’t want to feel like this every time I go to the place where I run in the mornings, I am worried that even if I change location it will be the same result and anyway I love the place that I run and I don’t want to stop going there altogether.

Usually when I run I will listen to music up until I feel anxious than call someone or I will switch to a podcast. This morning even though I was on the phone to someone I was just too overwhelmed and had to turn back."
What am I feeling!?,"Ive been experiencing something that is so hard to explain. Ive been to the doctor twice about it and they say its my sinuses. But it just seems like they are guessing. They dont do any tests. I cant even describe it properly to them. So whats happening is: my eyes feel ""weird."" I ALMOST feel dizzy, but not quite. Its the most intense when im in the woods. It almost feels like my eyes are trying to take it all in, but i cant. Its ALMOST like i cant focus, but i can. It also makes me feel like my eyes are heavy, and my mouth wants to frown, like it feels weak, or something. Going on a walk almost puts me in a bad mood, because of the stress of this feeling, while walking. Im like trying to look at everything, but it just feels WEIRD. God this sounds so ridiculous. how am i supposed to get help if i cant even explain it? I do have anxiety. I do have ""health anxiety"" but i felt like ive been controlling it, and it seems to still be there. I feel the best first thing in the morning. rarely, some days i feel fine. It also get worse when i smoke weed. I stopped smoking weed. I try to search the internet, i try to talk to doctors. I just cant explain it fully! i say "" i feel  slightly dizzy"" or "" my eyes dont properly focus"" but both of those arent true, its just the only way i can put it into human words, lol. I guess this is anxiety related? hoping to see if any one can relate. love"
What happens when you go to the hospital because of anxiety?,What does the ER when you show up with anxiety/panic attacks? Asking for a friend.
Did this happen to anyone else before?,"TW: i'm describing panic attack symptoms and anxiety


So i've been struggling with very bad anxiety and panic attacks for about 8 yrs now, i'm in therapy and on meds though so yeah, everything more or less ok. I mainly get anxiety from being overwhelmed and stress. 

So today i (f/19) got into an anxiety attack like state after overhearing my parents talk/argue about getting divorced, it was really just a very stressful, overwhelming and sad situation for me. I felt my whole body cramping up and shaking and i teared up. Later, i talked to my brother and i just couldnt concentrate at all, he had to repeat every sentence at least 3 times. I wasnt panicking anymore or anything, it just seemed like my brain had shut down. I had a song in my head (like normal yk) and all of a sudden, it just became so loud i couldnt hear anything anymore, i zoned out completely, it was like passing out for a few seconds. I also still feel as if i hear everything through a thin wall of cotton. I never experienced this before. Does anyone know what this is/had this happen to them before?"
What helped with IBS?,"Hello, for the ones who are diagnosed with IBS and who notice their symptoms are worse when they are anxious, did therapy help you with controlling your symptoms better? And if you can, please tell me what was your symptoms. For me my primary symptom is nausea ( rarely I actually throw up from it) and sometimes diarrhea. I am actually more worried about the fact that I’m in public and this actually makes it worse. I also have this irrational fear that if I don’t throw up right away I will aspirate in my lungs and die. Please help, anything helps!"
Anxiety,"I constantly have something on my mind and im starting to think i have anxiety. as stupid as it sounds i can convince myself that im THE worst at something and it seems so believable. either i think im the worst looking, the dumbest, the shittest at a sport, the most anti social, that im hated by everyone and etc.

its so much fucking bs cuz i cant ever let my guard down since whenever i do these thoughts get louder. the past few months i hadnt had many thoughts like that so i started relaxing, now that ive started uni and im
in a new city where i barely know anyone and the people around me arent my type of people i constantly have new shit on my mind.

how do i avoid letting myself spiral down with a thought."
Starting my path to emotional freedom,"Guys I've done it, I've booked some therapy. I sat down with my partner tonight and we looked through loads of different options, what I want/need, and what kind of therapy would be best for me. 

I've narrowed it down to 4 people, who I've emailed and I'm now waiting to hear back from them and see which one I'm drawn too. 

I'm nervous, excited and everything in between. I hope this will be the answer to everything I've been feeling over these last few years, and help me to finally feel like my old self again. I never realised how deep into this I got, and honestly, I don't like it.

I cannot wait to start this journey, and I'm honestly so lucky to have such a supportive partner by my side helping me through this journey. 

(To clarify, my partner isn't forcing therapy or anything on me, it's 100% been my decision)."
Starting university tomorrow and I’m dreading it,"So it’s my first day at uni tomorrow, I’m 19 and from the UK. I left my old course (which was all online) and took a year off to work on myself but pretty much done nothing for the year. I’ve been out with friends and I’ve started learning to drive which have boosted my confidence which is good. However I’m just concerned about tomorrow as I don’t know anyone and I’m not very good at talking and making friends Most of the people on my course have done a foundation year and seems like they have already made friendships, not to mention that I missed fresher week because I was on holiday putting me at a disadvantage. Anyone have any good advice out there? I know a lot of people probably suffer more than me and it’s nice knowing I’m not the only one."
What are your tips and tricks to manage your health anxiety?,"I think we can all agree that anxiety produces lots of symptoms that feel very very real and serious. What are your best tips and strategies for telling those apart from real situations or calming yourself down and snapping ourself out of the anxiety?

In my personal case I always worry that if I dismiss a symptom it’s gonna be the one time it’s something real or serious. How do you overcome that thought or know ok this is the real deal vs anxiety?"
Uni starts tomorrow and my chest is burning,"It’s my fifth year in university. I changed my major and went to another uni and tomorrow my third year there starts but for some reason, I am anxious as hell. I’m an introverted guy and I get nervous and anxious about social situations pretty often but I’m used to that and can deal with it pretty easily but this time I don’t even know what I am anxious about. The feeling is just there for about a week and I’ve been acting pretty aggressive or moody towards everyone. In the past I dealt with it by just fighting it until it disappeared but this time I just feel so burnt out to fight it which is kinda scary for me. Any advice is appreciated :/"
Terrified of talking to my landlady,"Hello, I am sorry in advance in this is not a right place to ask but I don't know where else to try and I'm desperate.
In February I moved in with two guys I know (but I wouldn't call them friends though). The flat is actually one of this guys mom's so she is our landlord. Stupidly I signed a contract for a whole year.
It was all right at first but then I realised how unhappy I was there, the boys were not cleaning after themselves or taking care of anything, they were living ""students life"" and since I started working it's been problematic for me.
For the last few months I felt so anxious around the house that I couldn't even leave my room. Now im paying for that room but I'm spending most of the time at my parents house.
But I found a cute and affordable place, all for myself. I've already contacted the owner and I can move in November. But the problem is that technically I have a valid contract at that previous place until February 2022. I'd have to call the landlady and ask her to terminate the contract and let me go earlier. 
But I feel so anxious to call her, I am terrified that she won't be happy with my decision or even say that I cannot move out earlier. Do you please have any tips on how to find strength to make this conversation?"
Fear of kissing anybody," I'm a 20/F and the other day I went to a party and this boy I liked was flirting with me, I knew that if I went with him alone he would try to kiss me and I panicked, my heart was beating super fast and I was extremely nervous, so basically I nicely refused to go on a walk with him. I regret that SO much, but at that moment I just shut down. Since then I have been uneasy and anxious I'm not sure why, I just feel bad that I couldn't pull myself together, I have never kissed anybody because any time there might be an opportunity I just sabotage it. I also lowkey feel ashamed of being this old and still haven't had my first kiss.

What should I do to improve my anxiousness:(("
Dealing with bad anxiety after moving house,"I have recently moved to London and finding it really difficult to get settled. I love the house but I'm still getting used to all the new noises of the property and feel extremely anxious and on edge all the time to the point where I'm struggling to go about my day as usual. It's been a bit of a difficult move (across far across country, problems sorting the hygiene of one of the rooms, no internet for a long time). I think I'm really sensitive to noise due to some nightmare neighbors from the previous house. Does anyone have any suggestions or tips to make my days more bearable? How do I settle in and stop feeling so dreadful? I feel sick and constantly have dreadful heart palpitations."
how to stop caring what other people think,"it’s so annoying like i’ll be in a zoom class, and i’ll talk and stuff and be myself and then afterward i replay it in my head and just think “what if i was being too much” or “what if saying this was perceived in a bad way” and i don’t get it and i just wish it’d stop like i know it’s pointless but dumb but i can’t make it go away. it’s been like so bad lately and this never used to really happen until recently. i’ve always had anxiety but this is like a new thing and i’m not a fan."

I went back to sleep and slept for 3 more hours. I now feel a bad anxious and guilty feeling. Does anyone else feel like this? Why do I feel guilt when I’ve done absolutely nothing wrong and have harmed no one. Quite frankly I probably even helped myself as it seems I needed the rest. I don’t like this feeling as it makes me feel like I’ve done something wrong.
Sudden onset panic after years of manageable anxiety.,"I don’t know what I’m looking for in posting this but I want to anyway. 
I am 27f, a bit overweight but otherwise healthy and active. Since I was in high school I’ve had manageable anxiety, no panic attacks ever, just typical anxieties day to day that I could usually quiet through meditation or exercise. On Sept 14, I had a full fledged panic attack and thought my heart was going to stop, my husband took me to the hospital where I was told it was anxiety and that my heart and everything else was fine. I was also given a prescription for Xanax, .5mg, that I have since taken 4 pills of. Since that first panic attack on the 14th I have had daily panic attacks lasting for hours, sometimes all night long. All of these attacks revolve around me thinking my heart is about to give out or that I’m going to stop breathing. That worry coupled with the physical symptoms of anxiety(shortness of breath and rapid heart rate) are keeping me in this state of constant fear and panic. I went to my regular doctor yesterday and she told me that I’m basically in perfect health and that made me feel better when I was in the office but the moment I left the panic set back in. I guess I’m looking for reassurance. The fact that this has set on so suddenly and nothing has been able to mitigate it is keeping me in that state of worry. I haven’t been able to go to work or really even go outside because I’m so scared. Nothing in my life has changed to trigger this anxiety. Has anyone else had this happen to them? I’m sorry for any spelling or grammar errors…anxiety."
I’ve been pushed over the edge today. I’m sick of my parents for a million reasons and I want to leave ASAP (I’m 18 and graduated HS),"TRIGGER WARNING: discussion of imagined injury to infants in the section with asterisks.

First, to be clear, my parents take good care of me and don’t hurt me, but I can’t be around them. It’s all mental and emotional. My mom has an unspecified mood disorder, probably  Bipolar, and my dad is easily angered/depressed. They used to fight almost every night, but it’s less frequent now since my dad stopped drinking. However, when my mom gets really upset she will scream that she wants a divorce or that she’s going to move back to Costa Rica by herself. That happen this morning. A while later I was watching tv with my dad.
********
We were watching a car commercial and started talking about car safety. He told me how a woman was holding a baby in the back of a car against her chest with the seatbelt over the baby. He proceeded to graphically talk about what would happen to the baby if a car accident happened. I was like “please don’t describe it like that”.  He kinda laughed and KEPT DOING IT. I told him firmly to stop and he described something truly horrific happening to a baby that I won’t repeat here. 

********

   
   He laughed at how upset I was getting. This happens sometimes. He think it’s so fucking funny to make me upset. My mom was in the other room and started laughing as i began to cry and yell at my dad to stop. I was standing there crying and both of them were just laughing. I felt so humiliated. Das was like “why are you upset? It didn’t really happen”  My mom was like “you’ve been really sensitive today. go take a nap”. (something happened with my mom too before that I’ll get to it later). I lost it and screamed at my dad “DON’T FUCKING TALK TO ME”.  I never ever scream the way I did then, but I was furious. I began to hyperventilate and ran into my room. I was losing it at this point. I’ve had anxiety attacks before but this was different. I just started shrieking while I was crying. I put my face down on my desk and just wailed and hyperventilated. 
   
   The only ever time I had a reaction like that was a few months ago when I got into an argument with my mom. I wanted to hurt myself and tried to call the suicide hotline, then my mom knocked on the door and I started screaming cause I thought she was gonna try to spank me or yell at me more. (I ended up going to a psychiatric hospital for 5 days) 

I can ’t believe my parents did this to me. They were so disrespectful of my feelings I couldn’t believe it. My teen brother is a real one though, he didn’t laugh at all and hugged me when I was crying. A lot of other shit happened before that too, this was just the last straw I guess. I’ll leave a comment with more details. 
   I usually keep my parents at arms length because my mom is bipolar and my dad is super conservative and doesn’t like most of the things I like. Lately, though, I was trying to get closer them cause “family is forever” or whatever people say. That’s down the drain now. I don’t hate them, but I’d like to get away from them ASAP. It’s not like they abuse me. They love me and take care of me 90% of the time. It’s just so many little things that have piled up over the years. My parents argue all the time. Also, and this is a big one, I am trans and neither of them would accept me if they knew. I have every right to believe that if I started medically transitioning they would have nothing to do with me.


tldr; today a lot of things happened and pushed me over the edge. I want to move out ASAP. 

I don’t have money, but I graduated high school in spring and i have a car and a learners permit. I’m thinking that if I get can manage to works two fast food/retail job I’ll be out of the house for a much longer time and I’ll make more money so I can move out ASAP. Also, I don’t have any friends I can stay with.
Any advice for me to be able to leave faster would be appreciated."
Anxiety over lump in leg,"Anyone have health anxiety? 

I’ve had a lump in my left thigh for awhile now. Probably 5+ years. It’s firm, doesn’t move, seems like it’s slowly growing. I’ve had a few doctors feel it and look at it but never seemed too concerned. 

I made the mistake of Googling and everything popped up about sarcomas (cancer) and the more I read about it the more I’m convinced I have it. 

I asked my doctor about an MRI and they said they don’t think it’s necessary. 

My doctor referred me to physical therapy instead. (I have no idea why) But doctor thinks maybe it’s scar tissue or something to do with the fascia. 

I’m wondering if I should see another doctor or a specialist. 

I can’t stop worrying about it. The anxiety this is causing is absolutely awful."
Everywhere I go I feel like all eyes on me.,Every movement is monitored and judged. I wish I could explain my actions. Explain why I do the things I do.  Please don't judge me. I can't stand the idea of someone looking down on me.  It paralyzes me.
Symptoms weeks after? Please help,"Hello everyone! I have been a Hypochondriac for a while… always googling my symptoms and believing I have it…. Long story short, in August I tried some edibles and a few hours later had my first ever panic attack… went to the hospital as I thought I had a stroke or something… they told me was a panic attack, and it continued every few days until about 2 weeks ago… since last month, I still feel parathesia around my body(tingles,burning etc). Even went to a Neurologist who conducted all the tests :( can symptoms last this long after panic attacks, and when my body was high on anxiety? I am still googling symptoms and coming up with new problems… 🥺 right now I am having jaw issues(TMJ), headaches, tense muscles and tingling and parathesia all over my body… was diagnosed by my Neuro with BFS(Benign Fesiculation Syndrome), as some of my body just twitches randomly.."
"Very Thirsty, no appetite","Am struggling with anxiety the last week due to a tinnitus flare up. I’ve also become sensitive to low-moderate level safe decibel noise in a way I never have been. It’s freaking me out and I’m likely still 10+ days from seeing a doctor unless my appointment gets moved up. A total of 20 days between onset of symptoms and seeing doctor. Seems like a long time and Ifeel like time is running short. 

Meanwhile, anxiety has come back full force worrying I’m losing hearing, on the verge of going fully deaf, etc. I’ve been very thirsty no matter how much I drink. I’ve also had very little appetite and basically force myself to eat. When eating mouth becomes very dry and swallowing is hard, almost like my body is trying to reject food. Why is this?"
What jobs work best for anxiety?,"I'm working as a cook at a restaurant right now (the owner is a family friend which is the only reason I'm comfortable there), but I'm trying to find a REMOTE job so I can have more flexibility with where I'm located. 

But every time I look at job listings I start bawling, because
1. Dont feel like I can do it
2. ""Must be able to work well under pressure and in a fast-paced environment""
3. Nothing looks interesting

So...is there anyone here that has been successful finding a good remote job that works well with anxiety? And how did you find it?

I have a bachelors degree in communication, but only very amateur experience in anything :/"
dancing against anxiety,"just wanted to share this because it helped me so much this evening. i was sitting at the couch doing nothing and noticed that my anxiety increased without any reason and yeah ... im still bad at stopping a panic attack (especially since i stopped drinking, because that was my coping mechanism). so i went to my room and threw up a stress ball and catched it really fast for like 10 minutes because that helps a bit but it didnt stopped the panic attack.

 so i put in headphones and turned on really loud and catchy music like the one that is played in clubs and danced. i danced for ... idk lol 30 minutes? i mean i REALLY danced i jumped and such things lol and i guess it looked really weird but who cares. i fucking felt the music and couldnt think about anything. it was awesome because guess what? my anxiety was gone and when i stopped i felt soooo good. you may know that you release a lot happiness hormones while dancing so it really helps.

 like i said just wanted to share, maybe it helps some if you :))"
Anxiety with working,"My anxiety prevents me from working and getting a job. I’m 20 and have never had a job. Not having a job was never a problem since I was always active in sports that consumed 6-7 days of each week, so I never had the opportunity. In the summers, I still would row and go to regattas but I also loved having time away from school and sports in the summer and used that time for vacations and having fun. 

I’m now in my sophomore year of college and have only 2 in person classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays, the rest I opted for online. I have a lot of down time that I try to fill with seeing my boyfriend but he also works, so it’s not always as much as I’d want to. I already miss him a lot when we’re apart so I know I need to be more proactive. I’ve started back at the gym a bit which was hard and still is but I want to get into a groove and be healthier, body and mind. 

In august, I got my first job at a gym at the front desk and working with kids. It was okay and my anxiety was very prevalent, but I managed the best I could. I ended up quitting after a week after having a male coworker constantly flirt and grab my waist as a way to funnily scare me, which it wasn’t at all. Instead of being upfront about my reasonings, I told my boss that I found a better job that was in my career path and needed to take it. In hindsight, I should’ve told the truth because no coworker should treat another coworker the way I was being constantly uncomfortable. This solidified my fears to not work and I just can’t see myself with a job like that yet. 

I’m in school to be a young kids teacher which I know won’t give me much anxiety since I love children but all the jobs available to me are ones I am not interested in and give me a lot of anxiety thinking about it. I’ve tried daycares but because I’m a student and can’t work full time, they can’t hire me. Babysitting is always too sporadic when I’d rather have a set schedule and nannying conflicts with my schooling. 

Right now, I would love to have a remote job since that’s all I feel I could manage right now. I know I also need to be saving money since there’s so much I want to achieve in life but I feel incapable. I’m working on improving my mental health but I know it’ll be a slow process so until then I guess a job that doesn’t require much seems the best to me.

I live at home still so I’m reliant upon my parents for everything and when I’m with my boyfriend, I’m reliant on him for things too. I don’t want to feel like a burden to people anymore and I want to be more self sufficient since the plan is to rent an apartment off campus either next semester or my junior year. Since I am fortunate enough that my parents can provide that for me, I want to prove to them that I can also provide for myself and make my own money but I genuinely don’t feel ready for a real job. 

If anyone has any jobs that are low anxiety jobs or ones that I can start online I would greatly appreciate it!! Just needed to vent and maybe get some advice :)"
Really considering voluntary inpatient psych hospital...,"I've been having such a hard time lately. The anxiety is through the roof at a all time high. Which is only making my depression crippling. I am almost at my limit with this. And I won't lie I have had many dark thoughts lately. I have no energy for anything anymore.

So if anyone has ever been to one how was it? Was it helpful?

To add my mom years ago put herself in one and said it was super helpful. And that I should never feel embarrassed about going."

"I just need to hear that i can do this and everything will be ok, maybe some advice please!","I'm in the process of helping my elderly, disabled dad move. He's not allowed to bring his cat with him to where he is moving, so i am taking her.

I have always been a cat lover and I've wanted a cat again for years. I've held off though because I've been raising a family and i didn't want to bring a cat home to 2 toddler girls who would absolutely love the cat, but might stress her out. She's used to living in a quiet retirement community and my house is the typical toddler household still. My girls are currently 3 and 4.

I'm having a TON of anxiety over bringing the cat home. I'm worried I'm going to ruin this cats nerves. When my dad first brought her home with him all she did was hide and run from every noise. It took her months to get fully comfortable and she's still not fond of strangers. My kids aren't strangers to her, and she's ok with them when they're calm. But when the kids get rowdy the cat gets scarce.

We can't find another better home for her right now. I don't feel comfortable taking her to the shelter, i love her. I've talked to my kids as much as you can about it to a 3 and 4 year old. They are excited to have her. 

Do you think she will adjust? She's 5 now. She likes affection. She just doesn't like noise. My house isn't that big, its just one floor of an average sized house. Do you think she will do ok? Does anybody have any tips on helping the cat adjust? Or am i overreacting because of my anxiety?"
Question about clonazepam,"hello! i am taking 0.75mg of clonazepam daily (3/4 of a 1mg pill) along with 100mg of sertraline. My doctor prescribed me to take 0.25mg of clonazepam with each meal (3 times a day) to make the 0.75mg, but i often forget and decided to take the entire dose at night. I have never had trouble with side effects or addiction (in fact i forget to take them at all sometimes) so my question is: does the way i take my medication matter in the effect it has on me? would it be different if i did take 1/4 pill throught the day instead of all at once at night???

i really hope this made sense 🤧🤧🤧 and thank you!!!"
Ditched,I met up with someone from the app bumble bff for drinks and thought we hit it off well.  He mentioned hanging out again and introducing me to people in his life.  I texted him to hang out and he didn’t answer.  This was a day ago.  I’m feeling insecure like I’m not good enough for his company.  Feel rejected and like a loser.  Anyone there to help me to chill out?
Sporadic Severe Anxiety-Anyone else?,"Hello!

Wanted to reach out and see if anyone else has had this experience… I don’t typically have major difficulties managing my anxiety and would describe the times I get stressed and slightly anxious as “normal” reactions to a stressful job, etc. 
however I have had 4-5 times, starting over the last two years, had extremely severe anxiety periods lasting for several days to a week. Up most of the night, heart racing, constantly thinking about what could go wrong, etc. It usually improves once I get more sleep and I can go months and months without experiencing it again. But like I said, when I do experience it, it is above and beyond. I can barely function and am at like a 10 the whole day and night.It seems to surround transitions in my life. Anyone else have a similar experience?? Even my therapist was a little mystified that it comes and goes sporadically but so intensely."
working with anxiety,"has anyone else found it hard to work (a job) w their anxiety? work can be exhausting as is, and it’s even more so when you’re in your head all day and beating yourself up. the physical symptoms make the time even more unbearable. 

i find that naturally, my anxiety is ofc worse when starting a job, since that’s the time where anyone would have anxious feelings. but my problem is, it carry’s much longer into the course of work, and i will begin overthinking things i’ve been doing for months. im really bad with talking to people as well, which creates a even worse work environment for me. i quit my last job months ago bc the training wasn’t helpful for me and i was too scared to say anything. i didn’t want to feel inadequate. i ghosted the boss and never returned to work.

i’ve been unemployed for months, and i’m so scared to begin working again. i find that the stress of my anxiety also causes me to disassociate and completely lose my concept of time. although im only 18 and a soon to be full time college student, i beat myself up for being unemployed. life revolves around work and that’s something i feel incapable of doing."
How do you cope with things that naturally give you anxiety?,I really enjoy taking pre workout but I can’t handle the amount of anxiety that the caffeine gives me after. The same thing goes with smoking weed. I’m never anxious about anything in particular but my heart always races so fast and I just feel too panicked to do anything productive. Does anybody have any advice with how to deal with this?
I don't think there's any hope anymore. I just want it to be over...,"I have been anxious since about 2016. I developed palpitations, skipped beats, and some scary episodes with my heart rate, and that has developed into this major obsession and anxiety disorder that got a million times worse with the pandemic.

I have been depressed only during the winter months, and I was still very functional. For a while, even with this amount of anxiety, I've stayed positive, hopeful, and very excited about getting this over with, but now it's scary. My anxiety is very crippling. I am obsessed with my heart. That it's going to beat too fast, fall out of rhythm, stop, etc. This means I can't experience anxiety or excitement without getting even more anxious.

I have tried therapy, reading books, deep breathing, meditation, exposure, etc. but I'm so TIRED! So exhausted. I gave in and started Zoloft, but I'm worse. I know these things are supposed to make you feel worse before you feel better, but I can't take it. I can't take even 1% increase in anxiety right now. I cannot do it any longer. I just want to escape these feelings. If medication, which was my last attempt to fix this doesn't work, then what else is there? I can't keep suffering and being a burden.

I am fucking EXHAUSTED."
"I (24F and bi) want to start dating people and eventually have a relationship, but my anxiety is making it such a hard process","I’ve never dated or kissed anyone before and I feel like I’m really behind on the dating game. 

I have some matches on dating apps and I want to ask to meet up in person, but I know once I initiate it my anxiety is going to be terrible the whole time leading up to the date. 

I take propranolol to lower my heart rate but I still can’t stop the feeling of dread I always have. I’m also nervous because I’m inexperienced and scared my dates would be turned off by that. Any advice would be appreciated."
infatuation: self destruction,"i've been talking to a girl on for a few days via dating app, and i'm just a mess right now.  
infatuation has always been so horrible to me.  i feel on the verge of crying. and feel so pathetic.   
i just feel like blocking her, because its too much.   


i have told her how i feel, and she said ""well, what's the worst that can happened. we can just be friends"" but i just don't want that, and rather i didn't know her now."
Near constant chest pain,"So, for the last three or four days I've been having some really frustrating chest pain/pressure that only goes away when I'm completely distracted from it. It doesn't matter what I'm thinking about, if I'm not fully focused, this pressure makes itself known. I went to the ER, and they did an x-ray, EKG, blood test, etc., but they didn't find any problems and said it's likely due to my panic/anxiety disorders.
The thing is though, this is pretty new to me. While I've had chest pain due to a panic attack or anxiety, it's never lasted this long, or been this bad, and it's making it even harder to function than normal.
What I'm wondering is if anything has similar symptoms, and if they have any suggestions to cope or even help relieve the pain I'm feeling.
(Important to note, I'm not currently on any medication other than mood stabilizers due to problems with insurance, and until that's fixed, I'm unfortunately on my own)

TL;DR: Having near constant chest pain/pressure due to anxiety/panic disorder, and it isn't caused by any underlying heart problems - looking for people with similar symptoms and advice."
Is my anxiety causing me to not want to eat?,"I usually can down a big meal without worry but for a few weeks Iv felt like it’s gotten harder to even eat half a meal, heck it’s gotten hard to swallow the food. I usually just force myself to swallow now because if I don’t eat I’d be worse off but idk why this is happening and why it’s been happening for so long now

Not to mention how my stomach hurts every time I eat and my pooping habits seem to have changed, almost like I’m stopped up"
I start a new job tomorrow after not working for over 3 years.,I feel very anxious about starting this job. Do you people have any advice for me? The racing thoughts come in waves just thinking about starting.
Idk how much longer I can do this,I literally find something to be anxious about 24/7. Even when there’s absolutely nothing to be anxious about I create something in my head. It’s driving me crazy and idk what to do. I have a therapist and take antidepressants and it still keeps happening.
Anyone else can't manage to do homework on sundays bc of sunday scaries?,"Every sundays makes me demotivated and working on homeworks make me feel very anxious. Except if I have a very close deadline and don't have a choice, I've never really managed to get much done on that day.

Is it the same for anyone else? I'm just wondering if I'm alone in feeling that way or if it is common."
Quitting my job,"I am a bit nervous of the outcome, but I am quitting my job due to anxiety. I have struggled with GAD, OCD, and vomiting problems for years and I want to just work on myself. It was my first ever job and it was in retail. I was doing well when I began, but I started having more and more frequent anxiety and panic attacks and it has gotten to the point where I throw up every day before work, multiple times a day. When I get anxious I throw up over and over for days in a row; even at the same times every day.

I want to find a medication that works right for me so I can get my life back. I want to get more frequent therapy. I want to be able to regain the weight that I have been rapidly shedding. I want to find happiness in myself and my hobbies again.

&#x200B;

I just wanted to throw this out there. I am feeling a mixture of regret and hope."
My heart just skipped a beat so hard,"It was almost painful. Now I have pain in my back/shoulders and I can’t tell if I’m having a minor panic attack because of what just happened, or if something is really wrong. Anyone else ever have a really hard skipped beat like that? I’m freaking out at the moment"
New to anxiety. Need help understanding what my mind/body is doing.,"Greetings. Hope you are doing well!

I've had some health issues lately that have made life a bit more difficult. Work has been a lot more stressful, marriage has been stressful, and to top it off, my wife is pregnant. There is a lot going on right now.

A couple weeks ago, while I was driving, my body started to get warm and tingly, my breathing almost felt like I wasn't getting enough oxygen, and I felt just uneasy overall. I thought I had having another stroke initially but it was full body and only lasted a few minutes with no other stroke-like symptoms.

I talked to my therapist about it. She thinks I had a panic attack. I tend to agree. She gave me a couple techniques to try but we haven't gotten around to discussing meds yet.

Sorry if I'm rambling but I have these couple questions.
1) Does it sound like I had a panic attack?
2) Can you have a panic attack randomly? As in you aren't in a particularly stressful situation but you have panic attack symptoms anyway?

I'm going to ask my doc about meds maybe. It's hard to decipher whether what's going on is related to mental health or the stroke I had or an oncoming stroke or the heart issues I have. It's all overwhelming."
Anxiety Attacks,"Hello everyone. I have been having anxiety attacks and I want to know how to stop them.

It first started last year when I was in school and having chest pain. I googled and convinced myself that I was having a full blown heart attack and thought I was dying and that gave me an anxiety attack.

Didn’t have any for a while until about 2 months ago where I convinced myself I had diabetes, this made me have an anxiety attack too. (I did not have diabetes)

About a month ago, I had pain and convinced myself that I was having a stroke. This sent me into a such a bad anxiety attack that my mom got scared and carried me to the hospital.

Last night I had a headache and subsequently convinced myself that I was having a brain aneurysm. I then had an anxiety attack that I was dying.

Logically I know that i’m fine, but I still start panicking and I still think i’m going to die. Why do I keep doing this? How do I stop?"
Can anxiety cause chronic nausea?,"I have a lot of health anxiety these days surrounding my migraines and an upcoming move. However, even on days when I feel perfectly fine and like myself again, I’ll get slapped with a random bout of nausea and sometimes I end up gagging. 

I fortunately have not thrown up at all but it gets intense and I’ll have to just sit there for a bit not doing anything. This obviously will then spark some anxiety. 

Does this happen to anyone else? Good days, bad days, it doesn’t matter. The nausea almost seems constant these days."
Anxiety is ruining my relationship,My anxiety has always won over anything I've tried to do. Sometimes I am able to push through and force myself to do things I don't want to but other times I avoid simple tasks or errands because I overthink every possible outcome. My girlfriend of a year and a half has been asking me to go out of state to meet her family and it's crippling me to even think about going. They have a tight knit family and I can't stop imagining how bad my anxiety will be if I go with her for a week. I tried to explain it to her and she said she feels like I use my anxiety as a crutch to get out of doing things. She later apologized when she saw how heartbreaking it was for me to hear that. I've always kept my feelings and anxious thoughts to myself for that exact reason. I never want to be seen as handicapped or like I'm using my mental state as an excuse. I just don't know what to do about any of this. Any advice or free treatment options would be greatly appreciated.
After 2 months on Zoloft its finally working,I developed some serious health anxiety about a year  ago. I put off taking meds for so long because I was scared of side effects. 2 months ago I started because anything could be better than the way I was feeling. One month on 50mg did nothing. Started to lose hope that I would be this way forever. Started 100mg almost a month ago and I finally have hope. I can feel things changing for the better. Might need one more dosage increase to fully kick anxietys ass but wow things are getting better.
Last night my heart rate was at 170 BPM while resting.,Last night was absolutely terrifying and the first experience I’ve had with what I assume to be an anxiety attack. I came home around midnight after having some drinks with friends. I was feeling pretty tired so I took a quick shower and hopped into bed. Once in bed my mind started racing (as it usually does) so I tossed and turned a bit. I also noticed that my heart rate seemed to be a bit high (minor palpitations). I decided to get on my Reddit and mindlessly scroll since I couldn’t sleep. As I was scrolling on my phone I kept noticing my heart rate being elevated so I decided to get up and take some deep breaths. I began pacing around the room when the shit hit the fan. My heart rate kept going faster and faster and the more I tried to relax the worse it got. I began to panic so I woke my brother up (it was about 2am) thinking I might need to go to the ER. Immediately upon talking to him my HR came down to about 125 which is obviously still quite high. I spent the next 3 hours laying on the sofa and just trying to rest/relax. My heart rate for the remainder of the evening hovered around 100 BPM before eventually falling asleep. Fast forward today and I’m feeling pretty terrible. Anxiety is still high as I’m worried about last nights experience. A lot of questions going through my mind… was this purely anxiety induced or perhaps a medical issue with my heart? Is this going to happen again? Why did it happen last night for the first time if I’ve always had anxiety? Heart rate today is around 85 BPM which is within normal range but still high for me. Any advice/tips on what my next steps should be would be greatly appreciated. I’ve always had what I would describe as “manageable anxiety.” I’ve never taken medication for anxiety.
I have ton of anxiety about flying,"I have a flight tomorrow and I already know how much hell it will be. I wish I could wake up one day and just be able to fly like a normal person. I can’t eat, I can’t sleep, and my heart is racing like crazy. Anyone else suffer with terrible anxiety while flying?"
I need help,I need help. I suffer from depression and anxiety. It stems from financial insecurities. I have a fear of not being able to provide for my children and wife. I never seem to get on top. Paycheck to paycheck. I’m a loser and a failure. This is my desperate last ditch effort ask for help. I’m hoping people can donate one dollar. That’s it. Just one dollar. Maybe enough people will see this to allow me to put something away to provide. Thank you. Anything helps. $ceodice55 cashapp.
I stopped my clonadine,"I researched it and

 1) I already have a heart rhythm problem so I should *not* be taking this... I told my Dr about my heart already so this has lost some belief on them

2) if one month I don't have the money, I fucking die?

Goddamn this medicine has caused me anxiety. 

I guess I will call tomorrow and tell them I'm not taking this. I stopped over a week ago but I just have not not called yet. 

I just feel discouraged"
Stroke or anxiety?,"Does anyone else get these bizarre and brief head rushes like a vertigo feeling with their anxiety?

I’ve gotten these a few times over the past few years where I’ll be doing anything like standing doing nothing or working on my computer and get these weird head rush feelings that last a few seconds then go away. Today, it happened twice back to back and then had a minor tension headache. I felt anxious afterward because it’s unsettling and now I’m here thinking I had a mini stroke or something. I’ve been pretty stressed and anxious lately since I have a lot going on in my life right now, so I’m hoping it’s just related to that."
Hoping for peoples opinions on Clonidine," Dr suggested I try clonidine as him and I suspect I may have ADHD and can't afford to see a psych to get anything like a stimulant. He suggested I stop taking my propranolol (10mg 3x a day) as the Clonidine also acts as an antianxiety medication similar to propranolol. They both treat hypertension and I shouldn't be doubling up. 

I took the Clonidine that day and found it made me super drowsy, reminded me of a pain killer or something. Gave me a pretty good feeling but didn't seem to help my inattention at all. 

I'm interested in other people's experiences, does the drowsiness go away with further use? Did it make anyone else feel pretty good? Like they are on codeine or something?"
I’m terrified of getting food poisoning and it’s getting in the way of my life.,"(long post) (TW sickness,vomiting)This phobia started when I was around 12 and I heard a story of a woman who got food poisoning from potato salad or something from Costco. She ended up being in the hospital for over a week and nearly dying. And even without having to go to the hospital, it sounds like the most horrific sickness. Extreme stomach pain and sickness, vomiting and diarrhea all terrify me way more than other types of being hurt/sick. I would rather break my arm than then have food poisoning. I’ve never gotten really sick from food (knock on wood), but the idea haunts me.

 I had a panic attack once when I cooked chicken tenders for myself because I thought it was undercooked/spoiled, even thought the meat was fine and I checked the internal temperature like 5 times. My dad talked some sense into me and for like 5 years I don’t really think about it. 
  The fear resurfaced recently, probably because I listened to a podcast and they started talking about how sick they all got from fast food pizza. Now the idea is stuck in my mind. It’s just the fact that it’s happens to so many people, and that it can come from basically ANYTHING. Greens have E. coli. Meat and eggs have salmonella. Canned things can have botulism. Who knows if this lunch meat was handled properly? Am I REALLY sure that the groceries are still safe, even though it was only in the trunk for an hour? 

   I cook for myself mostly, but that seems to make the fear a lot worse. (But now I am suspicious of restaurants as well.) I used to have no fear about what I ate, but now I have to sniff everything to make sure it isn’t sour. Am I sure that this sandwich meat isn’t old? Am I sure that this lettuce doesn’t have E.coli in it. (I love Taco Bell, actually, but cross my heart I will never step foot into a Chipotle in my life. Like over 100 people got actual food poisoning from that place why the fuck do people go there )  

Last night and this morning I used salad greens that were wilty and kinda wet but still 4 days away from expiring. “Prewashed” but I still rinsed them. I ate a sandwich with the greens and meat that I sniffed and tasted to make sure it was safe. But as soon as my stomach gurgled/started settling, it’s like a switch flips in my brain and I start thinking “oh god this is it. Its gonna hurt so so bad. I have e. Coli. Oh god the meat /was/ off. What if I I have to go to the hospital??” I started panting and my hands got clammy. Last night, I forced myself to vomit and kept hyperventilating. Every little feeling I had in my stomach was a sure sign that something I ate was bad. 
    I calmed down and thought “oh wait it’s not that bad.” But even hours later, if I have any kind of pain in my stomach I get freaked out again. (I really screwed myself over once I read online that it can hit you up to 15 hours later.) I’m in the bathroom now and my stomach is hurting again. I ate breakfast about 2 hours ago. Trying not to cry. I’m so terrified of the pain that could be coming.

TLDR. How do I prevent myself from getting sick? What can I do to reassure myself that I won’t be sick now or later? I don’t want to live my life this way. Any help is appreciated."
Anxiety & OCD Flare Up,"I’ve been going through a “rough patch” with my anxiety and OCD especially with the intrusive thoughts. They mess me up the most because they’re things I DON’T want to do and scare the hell out of me which then causes my anxiety to turn on full force. I don’t like not feeling like me. I tend to be that happy and always laughing person and I thrive feeling that way. So, to constantly wake up and feel anxious and have my OCD throwing random intrusive thoughts in my head is terrifying. I’ve had a lot of changes since April that have been stressful. I work in veterinary medicine as a tech and we’ve been overrun and overworked lately and I’m a manager of the surgery department. People are constantly freaking out to me over issues lately. My boyfriend and I just moved into a house together in July which was a huge step. When I’ve done that in the past in relationships it’s never been a good time and I have PTSD from relationships. I don’t feel like my house is home yet. I’ve been petsitting back to back all summer and now that I’m finally home my boyfriend is traveling for work. I’m mentally drained from the pandemic I just want it to be over. My friends are all not in the best head space right now and my best friend is being super negative and dragging me down. 

BUT, I’ve made this changes currently. I’ve been seeing my therapist weekly for the past 6 weeks. I had an appt with my psychiatrist and he bumped up my lexapro and klonopin temporarily to help get me over this rough patch. I deleted Facebook so I wouldn’t have to see negative posts. I started a membership at a gym so I can run and work out some of this physical nervous energy I feel and stress from work. I’ve cut back on caffeine. 

Basically I’m just venting and want this rough patch to be over so I can go back to feeling myself again. Thanks for reading my rant if you did"
Anyone knows any medication that can help with energy and depression?,"I'm taking Lexapro, it was good at first with the 20mg. But now I feel depression creeping back up and don't feel like doing anything. I haven't cleaned my appointment in a month and a half."
How do you guys deal when you make a mistake while driving and you feel like shit because of it.,Ive been driving for a month now and I feel like shit. I make so many mistakes while driving. Most days it’s just small mistake that i doubt anyone will notice like I turned too wide. Or I’m going a little too slow a little too fast. But I feel like shit when I do them. It is mentally exhausting. I’m still trying to cope with it. How do you guys do it?
Surgery,"Im 18 and my mother had to be taken in for a ruptured appendix yesterday and is having it done today with possibly a hysterectomy in the same anesthesia round. I couldn’t sleep at all tonight and I can’t go visit or ask considering the hospital is almost 30 miles away. Im scared out of my mind even though there haven’t been any immediate infections and her blood sugar was near perfect for the past couple of weeks. 

I can’t stop googling things and I feel so terribly helpless that it’s made my stomach sick. Has anyone else felt this bad?"
Anxiety is killing all my pleasures,"I am a 20 yo male, living in Europe, diagnosed with anxiety and moderate depression. I discovered my situation very recently, after a period in which an ever increasing amounts of bad thoughts started crossing my mind. I talked to my parents about this and I am now undergoing medication and counseling.

I used to be very different from what I am now. I used to travel, go out with friends quite often, go study in a library, stay at home alone for a few weeks without any fears. I used to love driving, making new experiences and so much more. Now I constantly have thoughts about something bad happening. I can't stay at home without thinking that there might be thieves wanting to enter my house or someone pointing a gun at me. I can't go and drive around without fearing that if someone were to cut me off and I honk at him, he might get out of the car and hurt me. I can't go out at night even with friends, because I am afraid that if I were to cross someone's eyes they might start a fight. I can't go to the car wash without thinking that someone will want to steal my car and do so in a violent way.

My situation is affecting me in so many different ways: I have a hard time studying, even though I have taken my mind off university for a whole month and I have selected courses I am really enjoying (I have never thought about leaving uni, getting a degree is just too important for me); I would love to get a motorcycle's license, but what's the point if then I am afraid to go out?; I rarely see my friends anymore and even though I explained this situation to them and my psychologist suggested to try and go out with them (which I have done very recently and I felt very well) I just can't imagine a return to a version of me without depression. I have always been anxious before taking a test or when doing something relevant for the first time, but this is way beyond anything I've ever felt. I am also extremely rational and I often read about how we're living in the safest period of human history, the world is getting safer year by year, the rate of homicides and wars is declining steadily. Reading this makes me feel good, but only for a very short period of time (minutes) whereas I used to have an extremely positive outlook about the world if I were to read the same information.

Has anyone felt the same way about these topics? How long will this go on? I want to take my life back. I read a lot of posts where people are anxious about public speaking, but almost none about being anxious of people's behavior like in my case. Thanks"
I’m so sick of health anxiety,"My throat feels slightly itchy is it allergies? Dust? Or  something worse 

Who knows but im panicking"
I feel like I’m constantly going to die again,"For a few short weeks I was able to ignore my anxiety and it seemed to work but outta nowhere for the past two days, Iv been afraid of death, thought of every health condition that could kill me, have so many feelings of pain and stuff and tired and abdominal pain. I can’t even keep my eyes open that much.
Yet every time I check my body for a heart issue I find nothing, every time I look for symptoms I find none, it’s getting bad and j need help"
Sporadic Headaches,Have anyone experienced unilateral tremors with sporadic headaches now and then with Anxiety on the left side of the head mainly?other times it would feel like a tight band on around the forehead(does not happen frequently)
Feeling of being incapable of things - proactively sabotage myself and want to abandon pursuits,"There's an instinctive feeling inside of me that i cannot do it, even though I know I'm a capable and intelligent person. I don't know if I've ever really tried as a result as I tend to just abandon things/rationalize not pursuing then further, even though I worry about and desire to achieve something so much. (also have a lot of traits of adhd/hyperactivity) Any advice / insights you can share on this? Thank you!"
Experiencing vertigo for the first time. Trying not to panic.,I’m having vertigo for the first time in my life. I spoke with my mom and a nurse and they both assured me I’m not going to die and take it easy and relax. I’m still feeling very scared that something is gonna happen to me. Has anyone here ever has vertigo before?? What helped?
Trying to summon the courage to ask my boss for a mental health break,"I work in a high demand field at a technology company. I have a team that reports to me and a laundry list of projects cycling through all the time.
Today, I'm paralyzed by what this week will bring me. Quarter end with two huge presentations that I'm unprepared for in front of the CEO and exec staff just this week alone. Big code releases with my stamp of approval, etc etc. Ugh. Combined with my family relying on me to provide, I feel like I'm slowly suffocating.
The sleepless nights, constant debilitating anxiety and panic episodes are too much for me to bear anymore. I need to speak up and say something but I'm terrified that it'll backfire and I'll lose career momentum. These aren't the kind of people you show weakness to. What the hell have I gotten myself into?
Working around these seemingly-confident executives has made feel like the problem is with me, but I'm starting to ask myself if I want any of this. I need time to decompress and reassess. I'm feeling compelled to ask for a week off for a mental health break just so I can stop and breathe, but I'm sheepishly fearing the stigma of it.
Anyway, thanks for the space to rant. I love you all, thank you for making me feel slightly less alone in all of this. Please wish me luck tomorrow."
Why is it that everytime i try to avoid stuff that i KNOW will make me depressed/angry/etc. i get anxious?,"This is a bit complicated to explain, but here's an example: let's say i'm in love with this guy and he gets a girlfriend. My friends find out and tell me. Obviously i'll be hurt but if i go to his instagram and see their pictures together, it'd hurt me even more, right? So you think ""well, just don't go to their instagram then"" and that's the thing. When i start trying to avoid something that i don't wanna see, i start getting anxious about it and i have no clue why. The anxiety only goes away after i do whatever i've been avoiding. It's like my brain WANTS me to see it and get hurt so it can be at peace afterwards for some reason??
 
What prompted me to ask this is that youtube keeps recommending me this video about a topic that i know will get me angry (specially if i go to the comment section) so i'm avoiding it but now i'm anxious because of it. Part of me is like ""go and see it, someday you will anyway so you can just get it over with now"" but why when i can simply AVOID IT? Why won't my brain let me avoid stuff?? Does this happen with anyone else?"
Anxiety after returning from a special occasion.,"Whenever I go to a function, occasion. I have fun but when it ends I miss it so much for days and days I get depressed I miss all the people I met there. This makes me depressed, anxious. I'm not able to move on for weeks. I get paranoid. Couple days ago, on a wedding, I saw a girl I really liked her but couldn't talk because of some reasons now I'm really paranoid, depressed. I wish I had talked to her even though we will never meet again. What should I do to move on? I keep thinking about her."
Listening to frequencies to help with anxiety,"I’ve recently been listening to different frequencies on YouTube whenever I can, and I’ve actually found some to be really helpful. Whether it’s a placebo effect or it really works, they definitely help lower my anxiety levels especially during panic attacks. The frequency I find the best for anxiety is 396Hz but I also find 432Hz and 528Hz effective. Does anyone else suffering from anxiety listen to these frequencies? If not maybe give it a go and tell me if it made you feel any better, I was low-key shocked at how it made me feel after about 45 mins of listening :)"
Will my dentist get mad at me?,"I have broken 3 brackets this month 2 of them because I keep on biting to things when I am anxious. I bite my pencil or my pen or my fingers to keep me relaxed amd grounded while the other one was when I accidently hit it with a chicken bone. I am so scared to go to my next appointment because I am scared that she will get mad at me. During the past months, I also broke around 7 brackets (not in the same month) with the same reasons. Will she get mad at me? I feel so sorry for her but I can't help it especially when I am anxious."
Started new pill,Just started to take a new pill (escitalopram) and my anxiety gets bad when i eat new stuff or take mew medication scared of allergy or side effects. Would definitely appreciate a hug!
Does anyone else clench their whole body from anxiety? if so what are your symptoms you have from it?,
I love the feeling of battling through anxiety and getting that feeling of relief after you beat it,
Little wins,"I just won a little battle with anxiety today! My anxiety is generalised but mostly stems from severe emetophobia, to the point where I often struggle to leave the house in case I suddenly get sick while away from my safe space. Today I took the dog for a walk, on my own. I took her down to the beach, let her off the lead (I never do this unless my husband is with me because I'm terrified she will run off) and walked her for over an hour. We did the whole beach, through the cliffside gardens and I only put her back on the lead when we got onto the streets. Also, I didn't take my anti-emetics with me. Feeling very proud of myself. F*** you anxiety!"
Do antidepressant withdrawl peak after a week of it starting,I started to get withdrawl last week and I mean last 2 days have gotten worse but today better they feel like they peaked within days
Heart Jumping When Deep Breathing,"Hey guys,

I'm 32, healthy and relatively in shape. I just ran a battery of exams and my heart is fine according to the cardiologist, but he wasn't much of a talker and as such I couldn't talk much about my problems.

&#x200B;

Quick weird question, does it happen to you guys when you exert yourself really hard and your heart rate goes up (as it should) that sometimes you get a heart jump (ectopic beat maybe or something similar in feeling) when you deep breathe? I get them only when I deep breathe and I only have one at the time I deep breathe. 

&#x200B;

Either when running fast (mostly after while recovering) or cycling fast (mostly at recovery) I get that feeling, even sniffling hard (because of running in cold weather) gives me one sometimes...  


I'm an anxious person, diagnosed with GAD and lately my heart has been too much the center of my attention, I won't deny it... And this might have come from some building up in my head for sure.

Doctor didn't even care about it, so I assume it's not bad, but still I'm curious to know if I'm the only one feeling this.

Thanks for your time

Best"
I got my covid vaccination today and it went really well,"I’ve been struggling with pretty bad social anxiety for several years now, I did CBT for a while and I didn’t really think it would actually help? But today I went and got my covid vaccine by myself and I was still anxious but it was actually a manageable amount of anxiety not an oh-my-gosh-i’m-gonna-die amount. It all went really well and I could actually talk to the nurse calmly and yeah, it was awesome to actually feel a noticeable difference? I feel really proud of myself."
Dorm Life Anxiety = Hearing Critical Voices,"Me: (Socially awkward, weak social skills, bad communication skills, verbally inarticulate)

A recipe for social disaster.

It's unavoidable living in a dorm because many spaces are shared and bathrooms are communal by gender.

During Week 0, everyone would greet each other and get to know one another. I managed to meet a few people but it got all too much and I shut down. Meaning.. I avoided making eye contact in fear and dread of potential small talk questions. You know, the nice pleasantries that help start friendships. Even when we start talking, I don't know what to say or ask. Super awkward. I fear I come across as disinterested and rude.

Now I feel everyone hates me.

It has gotten so bad that I can hear people call me negative curse words under their breath or aloud at me.

Whenever people walk past me or interact with me, I hear them call me a b**** or w**** or h**. Idk if it is real or imagined. So after any time in public (going to dining halls, eating, walking to class), it's incredibly stressful. I've already cried so many times too, embarrassing to admit.

Some people even lowered their masks temporarily to mutter an obscenity at me, then quickly raise it. Idk who they are, even.

The worker who swipes us in at the dining hall also called me an obscenity. I wanted to make sure so I asked ""Sorry?"" but she gave me a straight stare with a knowing smile as if she said what she said and meant it.

I understand not everyone will like me. Same vice versa. And that everyones busy with their own lives and dont give two cents about me. but i cant help feeling like theyre talking about me or abhor every single atom that makes up me.

But I feel like an outcast and everyone just hates me. I haven't done anything, at least not that I am aware. But I keep hearing people reply to me with profanities.

I also feel constantly judged and scrutinized 

For example: lets say myself or the other person on my floor or strangrr will hold the door open for me/them/him/her, If i say thank you, the other person replies yes or no problem the says the b or h word at me. Is this imagined?

If its not imagined then i must be doing something wrong or did something wrong. cause if an entire floor of peers all think im a b or h, then.. the problem probably is with me right?

Idk what to do. Some strands of hair turned white on my head from stress lol...  I get teary all the time. And classes only just started..!!! 

I want to focus on classes but this is so difficult for me. do you have any tips or insights on this?

i kinda wonder if its sensory overload from there being so many people around all the time. country girl inna city kind of thing. but it just.. their voices are so real. i think they are real T-T"
Cant sleep,"8am and I’ve been awake the whole night. The last 3 hours I’ve been trying to sleep. But I can’t. One of my nose is blocked and my throat feels like I burped too much and it have a lot of saliva. Just feels uncomfortable. It’s like I can’t breath.  Many times I almost fell asleep but I would wake up to me gasping for air.  

I just would like some encouraging words because my whole family is sleeping  (Sunday morning)😫"
My anxiety goes haywire when I'm in cars and I'm being forced into a decently long car journey next week - any advice on how to make it go smooth?,"My anxiety is at it's worst for some reason when I'm travelling in a car and my parents are forcing me to go on a 30-40 min car journey next week with no say in the matter. 

I can barely go on 5 minute journeys without breaking down from anxiety attacks and I'm left an emotional wreck for a few days or so after that. 

Any advice on how to make it as smooth as possible would be much appreciated. 

Thanks."
Relationship Anxiety,Does anyone else get super anxious that they accidentally flirt with someone who isn’t your significant other or something like that? Every time I go to a party the next morning I’m paralyzed with anxiety that I did something wrong and my mind obsesses over it :(
does it make sense to skip one year of university to recover from anxiety?,"so ive been living with anxiety for almost 5 years and im so tired of it. i took the university exam and i registered to a university that is far away from my city. i have to stay at a dormitory which is awful. my school is so damn big and crowded which makes me so anxious. i have lots of other problems like agoraphobia, emetophobia, depression and panic attack. my emetophobia is so damn bad it keeps me away from everything. so i can just suspend my university for one year and go back to my home and get a therapy session for one year. i want to do this because i cant stand this curse anymore. last night, i had a horrible panic attack at my dormitory room and i even thought about killing myself. my body is also affected by this situation because i cant eat or sleep. what should i do? i have 5 hours to make a decision."
I cried in front of my asthma nurse and feel like a jerk,I went to my asthma review today and iv been on prozac and have come off abruptly due to suicidal thoughts anyways the withdrawl effects started a few days ago and have peaked yesterday and today so now I cry some of the day especially in the morning I went at 11 and these thoughts come into my mind and although I dismiss them and know they'll go soon I just randomly over nothing just started crying and it just makes me feel so angry at myself as she didn't know what was happening and I just felt so bad she asked for a doctor and I didn't want the help cause I know what is happening I just said to her iv got GAD which I do have that is why I went on them sorry if that offended people in any way and I said I'm fine
"Breathing anxiety / worried I can't breathe, even though I am breathing","Ever since Covid began, I developed this huge anxiety around being able to breathe. I'll be so worried I won't be able to breathe, while I'm sitting there breathing, or worried that I can't inhale enough of a breath, or that I'm suddenly going to be unable to breathe. It usually doesn't afflict me during the day, but it plagues me greatly at night when I'm trying to fall asleep or any other moments when I'm trying to just relax and not do anything. When I am not preoccupied with something, my mind won't rest and I'll start overthinking my breathing. I'll lay there for so long worried I'm not able to breathe well enough, even though I'm laying there breathing the same as I always have. Rationally, I know I'm breathing and I'm fine, but I can't stop myself from worrying.

When the pandemic first hit, for the first couple of months it plagued me every night and during the day when I was alone. When I first woke up, it felt like I was on the verge of a panic attack because I felt so anxious about being able to breathe. It gradually grew less intense, and it hasn't really affected me so much for a while until now. Today, while trying to fall asleep, I was right on the edge of falling asleep when the anxiety suddenly hit me and I found myself overanalyzing my breathing. I must've just laid here for twenty minutes worried I'm not able to breathe well enough before I decided to post here.

What can I do to alleviate this anxiety? I even went to the doctor a couple weeks ago for a regular checkup, and when he checked my breathing, he said it was good and didn't have anything remarkable to say. Despite that, I'm still feeling this way."
Get medication?,"Well, I think I am dealing with anxiety a long time ago but the last two weeks have been a completely  nightmare. I can't stop crying, I feel guilty about everything, Im constantly scared to do something wrong... Etc. 
I am with a therapist and helps me a lot but these last few weeks I have been going through a lot and I can no longer control what is happening to me. I told her that I felt the anxiety was becoming unbearable but she didn't say anything about medication, just to drink tea. Should I tell her explicitly that I want medication? Is it a good idea to take them?"
Can constant stress and anxiety effect your head daily?,"My head seems to feel woozy and a little lightheaded/dizzy often. I get allot of tension headaches back of my neck/head temples and eyes. When the headache isn’t there i still think the tension is still there lingering. Maybe that’s what is making my head feel the way it does. When i go out for walks or shops or anything like that my head feels like it’s on another plant, when i close my eyes it feels like my head is working 1000 miles an hour if you get me prob giving me that slight dizzy feeling. Looking to go on tablets tomorrow so hopefully it’ll get better and i also start my CBT soon too. Felt this way for years makes me not want to go out. I suffer bad with health anxiety, socials anxiety and just GAD in general"
I just fucked up at my first job,"So my normal working shifts are Monday, Wednesday and Saturday. Last week asked me if I could come in on Sunday and I said sure. I checked the schedule multiple times and I assumed that the 9-2 on Sunday they wrote down was just temporary because they never told me it was permanent. 

And now I had to speak to the owner (who isn't the nicest) and explain why I couldn't come in (which was because I had a family outing planned today) its only been like my 1 first week or so and I am a teen. Any advice? I dont think I'll get fired but probably won't be seen as the nicest? I'm really anxious right now."
I’m leaving Reddit to try to feel better,"I’ve spoken to some amazing people here and it’s been a great support network.

However I’ve realised that I’ve gotten everything I could get out of this experience and now it’s become overwhelming.

My brain wants to soak up all of the information but is drawn to negativity.

I need to leave to try and bring myself back to reality. The world isn’t as bad as my brain wants me to think.

Big surgery coming up which has really been playing on my mind. Suicidal thoughts have been hitting me hard. I need to ground myself.

I’m going to take some time off work and try to focus on more productive activities instead of social media which are a drain on me.

I would like to thank all of you. I wish you all the best in life. Anxiety disorders truly are hell to deal with.

This is my last day on Reddit then I’m signing off. 

I might revisit this in a few years time. I hope I make it out with a better life.

Much love,

Rhys

"Niacin ( flushing type ) , it works","Yesterday i took 500 mg , flushed for like 2 hours then started feeling  calm. i am on 10 mg  Lexapro which is not really effective with my anxiety . I woke up today and i feel great .

Why must this be a life long condition!?,"Raise your hand if you've had an anxiety attack at work! Now I'm worried they will fire me or convince me to quit like my last job ""coz I can't handle the stress"". Since I'm a casual they don't need to give me a reason or a warning. Fml."

Moving Anxiety,"After church today I make the drive back home and get ready to start my work week, but this time with a twist.  I have to start planning a move for the month of November.  I'm really anxious about this move because I have many choices to make, and right now my brain seems to be trending towards the ones that will change my life in major ways.  My mind just goes into instant panic mode whenever I consider these options and it makes my decision making ability seemingly vanish.

While I spend probably the next few weeks agonizing over all of this unfortunately, I would really appreciate some advice and/or support."
Does anyone else have this issue?,"Does anyone else have this problem where they get anxiety about losing their love or their interest/passion for something? Like for example you go somewhere, and when you come back you just have this unending feeling of dread about whether you’ll lose your interest in something? I went on a boat ride with some family members of mine yesterday for my brother’s birthday and when I got back home I had this feeling, thinking that I would lose my interest in the things that I love. It’s weird and ultimately irrational, but I need to know if I’m the only one. And how I can help mitigate this problem."
I'm going to therapy...,"I have been self-diagnosed with anxiety for about 2 years now, but i only realized that i have anxiety, like, a year ago. I'm 100% sure i have anxiety. As soon as i step out of my house i become self conscious, i start shaking, i walk weirdly, my heart starts pounding heavily, etc... 

My parents realized yesterday that i was shaking while we were at the mall. Today, my mom started talking about it with me and she told me that I'm probably gonna go to therapy soon. I don't really mind that because it's for the best, but the problem is, i know the biggest reason for my anxiety and nobody else does... And that is, i was being bullied in middle school (I'm in highschool rn). This is the biggest reason why i haven't told my parents about my anxiety before, because i never told them i was being bullied. The reason i didn't tell them is because i feared that they would judge me, and yell at me for not doing anything to stand up for myself, in fact my self-confidence was so bad that i was hanging out with my bullies. I realized later that i made a big mistake because i haven't told my parents since day one that i was being bullied and if i told them now they would be much more mad at me. While my mom and i were talking today, she asked me if i was bullied in school and i lied... I can't even tell my brother the truth, and he is the the only person i don't feel anxious around.

I fear that when i start going to therapy, my therapist would most likely ask what's the reason for my anxiety, and i really don't wanna lie, but if i say it's because of bullying he will most likely tell my parents, and i can't even imagine how mad they would be at me for not telling them before. 

I don't know what to do. I can say that i was always shy and that my self-confidence was always bad (which i also true) but now it turned into anxiety, or i can say the truth and endure my parents yelling at me. I know what's the right thing to do but i don't think i have enough confidence to tell the truth."
Does anyone else get super anxious being around peers develop friendships?,"I recently got into university and as someone who has severe social anxiety I’ve always found it hard to make new friends, especially groups of friends.  I feel like every second I fail to interact with others their social circle starts to close up.  I keep missing opportunities to include myself and now they’re slowly starting to stay with people better than me.  I had the same problem throughout high school and ended up with barely any friends left and severe depression.  I don’t know if I can handle another 4 years without ending it."
Does anxiety need to be triggered?,"From the conversations I’ve had with people about my anxiety, they often tell me to try and remove whatever is causing it. But I can’t really ever pinpoint one thing, it’s like randomly throughout the day I just feel really anxious and queasy without even having to think about something . Is anyone else the same or do people actually know why they get anxiety and I’m just stupid?"
anxiety,can't sleep. make it stop
Set your intention,"Happy Sunday /r/Anxiety! 

It's everyone's favorite day of the week... Sunday, the last 24 hours before Monday rears its head again. Let this thread be a space to set your intentions, share your goals and concerns, or just to check in, about the week ahead."
Forgot meds,"As stated in the title, I forgot to bring my meds during travel. The last time I took them was Thursday and shit has been difficult to say the least. I can't walk for longer than five minutes without the dizziness just completely throwing me off and I'm just irritable 24/7. I keep pushing away my fiancé and all my fears and insecurities are eating away at me. It's really hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel, which is sometime in the middle of next week. Yesterday I didn't eat and I haven't brushed my teeth since yesterday either, because such a mundane task just feels like an insurmountable ask. 
If any of you have dealt with a task like this, how did you cope for the time being? It's hard to think positive"
Please help,"So I have been getting this weird feeling especially at night when I’m just about to fall asleep it’s like a sinking dizzy feeling then I end up with like butterflies in my tummy, it can also happen when I’m just sitting watching tv too it’s terrifying but my doc seems to think it is anxiety, does anyone else have this kind of thing happen to them"
I cancel plans often,"I always try to at least give myself a buffer like, “I’ll try to make it” or “I’ll do my best to be there”. I highly recommend using phrases like this (especially if you’re being genuine!) because it doesn’t tie you to a definite YES but you express that you’re interested and will actually try your best. Before covid, I feel like I went to things 90% of the time. Like why not? I would give myself a time limit and most of the time, my extroverted self would come out. I’d feel tired and depleted afterward but that’s fine.  For context, I live on the fringe of a major city but within an hour on public transportation. This alone is stressful AF to deal with - before and after covid. But I’d do it in most cases.

Lately, I’m not sure if it’s increased social anxiety due to not seeing my friends in person for so long or if I’m just more hyper aware of the lengths it takes me to get to places, but I’ve turned into a flanker. Or at least that’s what my brain is telling me I am. Sometimes you have to commit to things and set a time/place. Lately, I’ll cancel before it even gets there or cancel the morning of and give an excuse. 

Does anyone else do this? Part of it for me is that I also just don’t want to travel an hour in a city riddled with covid cases but it seems like I’m always expected to. Maybe I need to start planning things near me and asking anyone who wants to see me needs to put my comfort first, and not the convenience of meeting right near their house/in their neighborhood."
It's hard to hide my anxiety because i'm usually very cheery.,But when my anxiety gets triggered i suddenly shut down completely.
Someone please help me,"I think I'm having an anxiety attack. I drank a cup of coffee for the first time in a month. Now my thoughts are racing and they don't feel right. Each thought that pops in gives me a rush of anxiety and I don't feel in control of them, they feel unreal.

I don't feel able to get off the bed, I feel like I'm going tk die any second, my heart isn't racing and I'm not breathing fast I just feel like I'm going to die.

Someone please help I'm all alone."
Help me find out where the final boss's theme song is coming from.,"So I've started this new job working from home as a call center agent, and so far so good. All my reasonable fears have been proven false: I had ample training, language isn't as big a barrier as antecipated and the amount of calls is manageable. Still, I'm a nervous wreck. Dry heaves, heart bursting from my chest, feeling like crying all the time. It's not my first job by any means, and the other ones were more demanding/ stressful, but I can't remember it ever being so bad. 
Can someone help me process this?"
Anxiety progress !,"M/26. Generalised anxiety disorder/panic disorder/medicated/7.5years

So yesterday night I was chillin, watchin movies with the boys, and movies give me pretty bad anxiety. So I was feeling really anxious. Like 7/10 and I didn’t really want to say how bad it was to the boys so I just dealt with it. But after the movies were done I needed to chill myself out and jump back in to reality. Which is usually easier said than done in my experience. I’ve read books and gone to therapy, I know a few techniques that help. Normally for me, posting on Reddit really helps but it kinda feels weird, Yknow? Like I’m being annoying for writing my thoughts and problems and posting it to the public. So anyways instead of doing that I pulled out an old note book and pen and I wrote my anxiety a letter. Sounds kinda weird but it worked. In the letter I basically told my anxiety that it’s an asshole and I’m not going to let it ruin my life. I also wrote about why I’m feeling anxious and that even though I’m struggling almost everyday I’m still not giving up no matter what. I have problems but I’m working on them. And I know that I’ll always be fine regardless of my anxiety and how shitty I feel at the time. After finishing the letter I instantly felt better. Facing my negativity and gaining control of my mind through a pen and paper worked great for me. I since then bought a journal and will continue documenting my progress and confronting my anxiety this way. I strongly recommend anyone try it. One thing I know for sure about anxiety is that words = power. Anyways that’s my rant and my advice. Hope it works for you like it did for me. 

Thanks for reading. ✌️😁"
Start my new job tomorrow and I'm bricking it,"Lost my last job just before Christmas and spent the time since searching. I've finally landed an apprenticeship in an office role which I've never worked in before (I used to work in education) and I'm incredibly anxious. 

Last few days I've felt it creeping in, standard worries of what if I'm bad at the job, what if I don't get on with my co-workers and with unemployment/pandemic I also just haven't interacted with people a whole much so it's getting back in the swing of things. 

In the same vein there is also excitement of the potential to find a role I thrive in, make some new friends and generally get into a healthy routine of actually doing things beyond endlessly applying for jobs. 

I am bricking it, I am anxious but got to go into this head on. Most of the fears are and will be purely fabricated by my own mind so it's about kicking them to the curb. Having said that if any of you want to send good vibes my way I'd appreciate that too!  


Have a cracking Sunday - hopefully tomorrow goes great and for any of you guys dreading or worrying about tomorrow, you've got this. You can smash it out of the park!"
"Can't fall asleep without vibrating, feeling hopeless!"," Alright guys, I was taking 7.5mg of Vortioxetine (trintellix) and one  month in I started getting those difficulty falling asleep. Whenever I  fall asleep my body wants to go full hypnagogic and do an ""astral  travel"" I am not really into esoteric, but lets call it Astral Travel. I  get the mini brain zaps, cold shivering, my body feels lighter and  colder. I then get the vibration feeling like I am vibrating completely.  If I try to let it, I just shake and convulse. I have to try and try  and try to fall asleep. At first I was so scared that I couldn't sleep  and the less I slept the more I thought that I was going insane. I  finally had an appointment with my GP and he prescribed seroquel and  said we would taper off Vortioxetine, however now seroquel makes my  whole body shake like crazy and this gives me even more anxiety. We  don't know if I am bipolar, we don't know if the anxiety etc is caused  by my Hormone replacement. We just don't know and I am a guinea pig. I  feel hopeless. I just want to go back to my older self before I tried  smoking weed (everything started after smoking weed). I have a family  history of bipolar and schizophrenia and knowing that makes me even more  anxious. Anyone has ever experienced that?"
Forming anxious attachments to people who aren't interested in me,"I wasn't sure where to post this. I guess it's a relationships issue, and I do have OCD but I feel like this relates more to my anxiety. 


Pretty much all my life I've had a cycle of becoming interested in someone romantically, and then my emotional wellbeing depends purely on the response I get from them.

My current situation is that I've met someone online (I play online video games and so tend to meet friends that way regularly) but this particular person I've taken a fondness to.

We have been playing together pretty much every night for the last 2 months and when we're done we'll spend an hour sometimes more just talking about general stuff. He suggested we swap numbers so we could send eachother pics of stuff we were talking about (food and stuff like that) so we did. We only talk as friends and he rarely ever messages me unless we're talking about a specific thing.

Despite the fact that he seems uninterested in me, I still feel so sad and anxious during the day and then get the highest of highs if he does reach out to me. I just feel like I'm never happy just in my own company, doing my own thing. I'm always relying on these people to throw me scraps.

I feel so frustrated that I'm like this. Why do I even care about someone who shows no interest in me? I was laying in bed last night and the rational part of my brain was saying 'this person who you've never met shouldn't dictate your happiness like this'. But I just can't stop feeling this way. I feel so silly and embarrassed to be honest. I'm 31.

I just needed to write this out because I feel so down."
Feeling dizzy is an anxiety symptom?,"This weekend I was out with family and friends when all of a sudden I started to feel quite dizzy. So I took myself outside to get some fresh air and have a moment to myself.

Unfortunately a few people followed me, with best intentions they tried to make sure I was okay. I obviously appreciate it but it just made me feel a whole lot worse. As in my mind, I felt some pressure to ""shake it off"" and I knew I just couldn't and I imagined myself getting worse and worse, even creating a ""scene"". 
Once I realized I was able to head home from that situation, I naturally started to feel a bit better. 
But through their comforting at the time, some of them suggested that I may have something like diabetes (!) and to go get tested. Whilst true and something that I should get tested, it's not what I needed to hear at that moment. 
Being a bit of a hypochondriac, it's plagued me all weekend that I might have to action these tests and I've not felt right since!

This morning, I received a message from my boss, just a casual chat about the week, it's fine and normal. But afterwards it instantly triggered another dizzy episode, the room was spinning. But despite all that I've mentioned, I'm quite good at rationalizing with myself. Because I could quite clearly see the trigger, I could quickly dissipate the dizziness.

I suppose the pressure to ""feel better"" to be able to make it to work, triggered the dizzy spell? The pressure to ""feel better"" during the first episode, made me worse. The pressure to look after my family (I am my wife's carer and we have a young child), is just always there, I don't really get a chance to rest. I mean, that not true, I get lots of free time. But it seems I have these dizzy spells at the worst time, such as both my wife and child need assistance at the same time! I don't want to let them down but sometimes I just need to sit down and gather myself, sometimes I can't and it makes me feel worse. 

Sorry, I'm new here, apologies if it's bad etiquette. I just needed to get this written down.

Hopefully someone can relate and let me know how they handle, especially feeling dizzy symptoms?"
Watched an amazing YouTube video,"Highly recommend. As a lot of us know we can be anxious about anxiety itself which is a viscious cycle. Just watched an amazing Ted Talk on YouTube called ""How to stop feeling anxious about anxiety"" and the guys perspective is incredible. Sometimes the symptoms of anxiety can be scarier than the initial thing that makes us anxious. Interested to hear what you think."
"Grocery store anxiety, I have it bad","too much ppl, the crowd but cashiers triggers my anxiety so much. my heart goes through the roof when im checking out, sweating like balls. 

so i been using self checkouts but it still triggers my anxiety. all those cameras monitoring my every move. it freaks me out and gives me so much anxiety"
"I thought I was getting better at dealing with anxiety, but now it’s completely out of control.","I’ve been dealing with anxiety all my life. I had to learn how to train myself on going through with the discomfort and pain anxiety caused me in order to be able to do things normal people do: going to school, going to university, taking exams, driving, meeting new people, anything new really. 

I learned, for a while, that feeling sick in relation to something new I was about to do, was “normal” for me, but something I had to overcome if I wanted to achieve something in life. 

I managed to move to another country, find a job, and making friends all on my own. For a while it seemed like I was getting really good at this “living a normal life” thing. 

Until the pandemic hit. It started with me being terrified of losing my job, then my sister instead lost her job (she lives in the same country as me) and so I was worrying about her. Then worrying about my parents getting sick, and my sisters getting sick. 

It got to a point where, when nothing was wrong with me and I shouldn’t had to worry about anything, I worried about other people, losing sleep even. 

And if I don’t worry about other people, then I start worrying about literally anything, even things I know makes no sense, like one night I couldn’t sleep because I was thinking that I didn’t want to die and be reincarnated in someone that lived in a super poor, war stricken country. 

How absurd is that?? 

And now anxiety has recently stopped me from accepting a job offer for a job in my field, that I’ve been pursuing for almost a year. The idea of changing job (even tho I wanted to!), starting from scratch and doing something new, the idea of being an impostor and being super under qualified, made me feel so sick that I couldn’t eat and sleep for 2 days. In the end,just to make the feeling stop, I chose to turn down the offer.

And now I’m beating myself over it because “what if I never get another opportunity “? 

I don’t know, I’m just tired of feeling like this and having people judging me because they think I’m lazy, when in reality I would love to do so many things but it’s just so painful!"
Does anyone with anxiety get that tense stomach thing,"Like your stomach muscles tense up so much it hurts after awhile and you can't seem to relax it.


Feeds into my health anxiety which seems to make it worse"
Does anyone else tell little lies now because of your past even when there’s no reason to? TW,I’m able to track back some of this but not all so I’m not sure where it’s true origin came from yet. I remember developing the skill at least as far back as high school when teachers would ask me 20 questions just so I could go work on something else in my free period. I garnish my reasoning of why I need to leave to make them less likely to say no. I grew up with a not great step dad and a mom who didn’t stick up for me so I would tell not total truths and answer bare minimum questions just to avoid the wrath of being berated/talked down to instead of being offered help. So now it’s turned into whenever a family member asks where I’m going and I’m going to see someone they don’t know or wanna do something without having to hear what they think I just say I’m with someone they know to avoid all the question surrounding who the new person is. Or if I want to go camping with a friend I don’t feel like being told all the reasons why it’s not a good idea. I just don’t like giving anyone 24/7 access to everything I’m doing and I don’t want to get wrapped up in meaningless conversations so I tell small lies even when I don’t need to I still do it because that’s how deep the habit is rooted.
Literally cannot sleep because of these mini “brain zaps”,"Yea so yesterday I went to the ER at like 3:30 AM and didn’t get home till like 8AM… it was an awful experience. Anyways, today I’m sitting here laying in bed trying to fall asleep and everytime my body drifts off into sleep I get what feels like a jolt of adrenaline that shoots up through my body as if I was jump scared but without the jumping part. Its happened probably 10+ times and It’s really driving me crazy, I’m so tired especially from yesterday, I slept from 8:30AM til like 2 PM so I’m not completely sleep deprived so I don’t know why I can’t just fall asleep. Does anyone know how to stop this? It probably doesn’t help that I didn’t eat anything till right before bed I made some eggs and drank an electrolyte drink."
Job interview,"I have a job interview in 2 days. It's perfect for me, ticks all the right boxes and would generally be a massive missed opportunity if I don't at least try. But I'm not ready. I quit my last job to get back on track with my mental health, and I haven't had enough time to get there yet. I only applied on a whim never believing I'd get an interview and now I've spent the last 4 days panicking. I have to do it or else I'll beat myself up about it and that'll get my anxiety going even more! I'm just not ready!"
Sudden anxiety outbreak when I didn't even know what anxiety really was," I am 20 years old, and up to my time in high school and also last year of work, I never suffered from anxiety (especially physically) in fact I didn't even know what it was practically. 

Then a lot has happened in the last few months, I broke up, I changed jobs, and especially an accident happened, On August 15th, I unconsciously mix a medicine (for allergy) and after smoking a joint, I start having a bad trip. , which led me to a sort of temporary derealization of about (3-4 days) 

   
From that experience something had changed in me, I felt very often pressure in the chest, blurred vision, dizziness that I did not immediately relate to anxiety but probably to my low blood pressure, but I was wrong. 

   
Now I have started a psychotherapeutic journey, to try to defeat these demons in my head.  I no longer feel myself, the sunny and productive person that I was, has faded a lot.  How could this have happened I ask myself again ... I swear to you that I have never suffered from all this, it exploded like this and I feel that my life is shattering."
Is anyone else a manager in the food industry ?,"I realize this is probably targeting a very specific group of people on this sub but I wanted to see if their is anyone else that goes through similar experiences as I do as a manager. 
Ironically a large majority of the staff really likes and respects me due to how calmly I can handle most insanely hectic situations but more often then not I find myself over analyzing just how badly I handled a situation and start to beat myself up over the premise of how I possibly could’ve done a better job, despite inner me knowing I did the best I possibly could’ve. I start to over think interactions I had with others and it’s just a new layer of stress knowing that at the end of the night I am responsible over how smoothly or bad a shift went for the whole crew and the individuals themselves Can anyone else relate to this ?"
Is what im feeling normal or is it actual anxiety? And should I talk to my doctor about it?,"Through out middleschool and highschool, I hated public speaking or having to present because I would get extremely nervous and get common physical symptoms such as rapid heart rate, upset stomach, sweating, etc. It would get so bad, that I would miss school to avoid doing it. If I couldn’t avoid it, I would stutter, turn bright red, and my head would go blank during presentions. Ice breakers/introductions where also anxiety inducing. For a while, I believed I had a mild form of social anxiety but I brushed it off because I dont like the idea of self diagnosing, and just told myself that these are normal feelings everyone goes through. 

Now im a sophomore in college, these feelings still follow me during social situations. However, I’ve been feeling very anxious for a different reason. Im so stressed out about my grades and so worried about the future, that it prevents me from living in the present. I always arrive to class 30 minutes early, and while I wait for it to start I catch my heart rate increasing and I have a hard time controlling my breathing. During class, I can’t even concentrate because im too busy worrying. When I’m studying, I suddenly have stop because I get small bursts of anxiety. This dread over the future overcomes me, and negative thoughts such as “you’re gonna fail all your classes” and “you’re not gonna be successful” pop up in my head. I’ve been having a hard time focusing and getting assignments done because of this. I know things like these are common in college students, so I’m hesistant to talk about it with my doctor or anyone for help, but I’m tired of having lived in an anxious state the majority of my life."

Anxiety over google review,"Hi, i’ve been really stressed since last night went to a restaurant with my dad and had a really bad experience with two members. I acted like I was calm and fine because my dad was kinda mad and wanted him to be less upset about the situation but omg my anxiety has been so bad. I left a google review and the restaurant accused me of being fake! I feel like they acted like my problems weren’t real and now i’ve just been feeling so sick since yesterday. I can’t sleep or stop thinking about it. I’m so upset ): they were so mean and I just don’t understand why. I can barely function right now I keep thinking about it. Feel so sick and sad bottomless pit in my stomach not coping very well. I hate confrontation and I feel so shit about it. I know im not wrong but now i’m so paranoid I don’t even know what’s going on anymore. Big sad ): 

Trying to be more assertive but I feel more shit than I did at the beginning): feeling so nauseous want to cry

Can someone help me how to cope with this? I already felt very uncomfortable leaving the review but I also feel like they invalidated my feelings and it was so hard for me to even say it in the first place. Feel so horrible. Please help any advice is appreciated."
Anxious about a low heart rate,"A normal heart rate is between 60 and 100, 60 is low and usually means you either healthy or dying usually healthy. But my heart rate has gotten below 50, and that’s not even taking in account for when I’m asleep. I have the excuse that I was an athlete, I swam for 12 years. But still I don’t think I should be nauseas, dizzy, and sometimes I get chest pain. I’ve gotten 4 ECGs, 2 chest X-rays, blood work, ultrasound of heart and I was cleared except for a sinus arythmia that could’ve been caused by dehydration, stress, or cardiac problems so I never know to be worried or not. Maybe it’s in result of quoting a sport that I was doing all my life or maybe it’s anxiety, or maybe I’m dying who knows?"
No wonder I’m feeling off,"In the past three months I have:

- switched directly from Paxil to Lexapro (went badly)
- went back to Paxil and added Abilify (tried it for two weeks and hated it)
- went back to just Paxil and added 1 mg of Ativan daily (though you’re not supposed to take it daily)
- tried testosterone injections (my testosterone is off-the-charts low for a 49yo)
- cross-tapered from Paxil to Lexapro (3 weeks now)
- added Ambien for sleep 
- stopped the testosterone because I felt like it was too many variables

So now I’m down to 10 mg Lexapro (3 weeks in), Ambien and 1 mg of Ativan. 

I’ve been feeling major physical anxiety, mood swings and zero motivation.  I think a lot of this has to do with still ramping up on the Lexapro and likely being “hooked” on the Ativan and getting “rebound anxiety”. It’s probably also not smart to be on Ambien too. 

So, I think I am going to try to taper off the Ativan and Ambien. I’m worried it will be really hard because I’m in a very stressful part of my job but I think I need to do this. Wish me luck and feel free to send advice."
I need help…,"Please, I’ve been having constant 24/7 anxiety and shaking and sweating for the past 4 months. Idk what to do. This is unbearable. I got into a motorcycle accident 3 almost 4 years ago. Was taking opioids for awhile. I stopped opioids 4 almost 5 months ago and since then I’ve had constant shaking and anxiety. To a point where I just want to end everything. Please help. I went to a doctor 3 weeks ago who prescribed me busiporne (anxiety meds) which haven’t helped. Please. I’m desperate. The only thing that helps is drinking alcohol but I don’t want to fall into this."
My face flushes so easily,My face flushes randomly when I talk to people even though I’m not feeling nervous. It also happens randomly out of nowhere. I find it flush a lot after playing an intense video game. I’m not feeling stressed or nervous. My flight or fight does not come on. Could it be more than that?
Does accidentally crossing (walking) when there is a car in distance close but you should have stopped mean your a bad driver?,
Anxiety Attack in School,"We had a group math presentation and when it was my turn to explain the math formula I blanked out, my hands became cold and my hands were shaking as well as my legs and bailed by asking my partner to take over. When we got back to the table, This one girl complained how awkward I did and we would get a 60% and told me to “just read the board it’s just numbers” WOW I told her out of frustration “I HAVE ANXIETY!” and wrote a letter to the teacher to take a walk outside as I’m having a anxiety attack and broke down in the hall. A lot of people walked pass without stppping because we live in a selfish world"
Mom is in the hospital,"I’m worried sick to my stomach for my mother who had her appendix ruptured and needs an appendectomy, my anxiety levels already spiked this high back when she was diagnosed with diabetes even though she’s kept it well under control the whole way. I keep googling the procedures which is messing me up hard. and apparently she would like to get her hysterectomy done as-well since she had it planned for a about a week or two from today. But ended up needing to go to the ER for a bad pain she felt in her stomach which she assumed was just gas since around yesterday. Though apparently it wasn’t bad enough to where she’d need an immediate surgery. 

I understand that nobody online could ever truly relate and I have faith that she will be able to pull through but I can’t stop making it worse for myself. Any tips or possible closure?"
How do I talk to women?,"(This is also a bit of a vent, but I think it helps paint the picture of my problems)

Backstory as to why I have this problem in the first place. When I was 15 I got my first girlfriend (which compared to my friends, I was pretty late in the game). The whole thing lasted two months. The reason we broke up? 

She was using me to get closer to one of my friends. 

Now, I understand that 15 is pretty young, and some might even role their eyes at the fact of “this 15 year old got his heart broken boo hoo”. I get that, but that’s bullshit, cuz that fucking HURT. It really fucked with my mind, started making me wonder 

“Does this mean I’m not good enough?” 

“Do people just not want to date me?” 

“Jesus Christ, what’s wrong with me?”, 

Shit like that. Also I’ve been hinted at several times that I’m ugly. Or at the very least not the most good looking person in the bunch. So that’s also fucked with me mentally. 

Anyways, fast forward. I’m in college, and I haven’t dated since I was 15. There are a ton of beautiful looking women all around. And the only problem is I can’t build up the courage to talk to them. Every time I see a girl I’d at least like to try and start a conversation with, I just can’t bring myself to do it. Also I feel I should mention I’ve never had a girl once try something like that with me. I’ve seen it happen to my friend/dormmate several time throughout the years. And it’s already happened a couple of times since college started, so I know I’m not crazy thinking that a girl not even giving me the time of day isn’t normal. 

So what should I do? How do I talk to women?"
Stress squeezing?,"For a while now I've had this weird issue and wanted to poke the community for suggestions. 

When I sleep or dissociate I unconsciously squeeze either my hands leaving nail marks or my legs and I don't even realize I'm doing it until I do and fully relax. I'm currently on Buspirone and it helps for the constant ""static tv"" ambient anxiety but not my weekly panick attacks. 

Thoughts? Thank you so much in advance!"
Anxiety Ridden for 17 years.,"Just here to complain. My anxiety, depression, and manic bipolar have pushed everyone I love away. I have tried getting a doctor for treatment but I've been unmedicated my entire life. I even stopped going to doctors the day I turned 18. I just got insurance for the first time and the first doctor my insurance assigned me was out of practice. So I had my insurance transfer me to another office. The second one wasn't even accepting new patients and didn't tell us until I was trying to schedule appointments with them.. The third doctor was booked out 8 months. And now the fourth doctor is not returning my voice mails I keep leaving them.. I've left 6 in about 3 months. I have severe and debilitating anxiety attacks every single day. They almost always start with tension in my chest  then my nose starts to close up and my hands begin to feel numb. I get a headache usually in my eyes. I start to feel weird, kind of airy, then I get cold sweats. My heart starts to race and pound. It gets hard to breathe. Then my heart rate drops. Good second or longer in-between heart beats. My hearing goes away and I start feeling super cold and I shiver. I feel like I'm going to die. I'm home alone tonight and I have Covid. No one cares. I can barely breath from Covid and it triggers my anxiety attacks. I've had 3 today and I feel another onsetting. I'm only 27 years old and I hate feeling like I'm going to die. I've had such a hard life and I've never learned how to enjoy basically anything. I just wish things were easier."
buspirone and drinking,"hi guys! is anyone here on buspirone and do you drink while using it? I'm not a heavy drinker, but my psychiatrist is sort of weird about alcohol and drug use. by this i mean that if you ask for guidance about alcohol while on a med you mostly get ""i don't approve of getting drunk"". she is sort of my only option right now bc the psychiatry is free through my university. anyway, I've been sticking really heavily to the one drink rule. has anyone's doctor advised them differently? I'm just scared I'll get drunk one night and not wake up or something. that's probably a little irrational, but hey-- that's why I'm on anxiety meds. 

tl;dr how much do you drink on buspirone? has anyone's doctor given them good guidance?"
Random anxiety is the worst,"Today i went out to eat and as soon as i got there i got this choking, dizzy feeling. I figured i was dehydrated, but here i am 6 hours later still feeling that way. Hopefully it’s just anxiety, but it’s still annoying."
Getting anxiety and homesickness at work. What should I do?,"Started job last monday, 1st week completed. Y'all cannot imagine how overwhelming this situation has become. 

I miss my parents, the comfort of my home, even though my office is in the same city as my house. I don't like the work. I wait for 6pm to happen so that I can rush and go to home and I can be around my parents. I get very anxious when I'm alone in the office. Feels like just quitting and going to home.

In the washroom, My eyes get wet thinking and I mildly cry because I miss my mother and I start getting deep breaths. I am single child of my parents, so the love and affection they've given me is impeccable, and maybe that's why I miss them so much.

I realise, I used to have the same thing when I was a little boy in play school and used to cry whole day just to go home. This is, probably the same sort of thing again, the only thing is, I'm in my 20s now. 

I'll be moving to abroad next year, away from my parents and family, Idk what I'd be doing there without meeting my parents for such a long time.

 Please somebody help me."

Awful family makes you awful,"For 24 years, I had been raised under tiger parenting, mistreated day & night. It wasn't until I resettled alone in Britain following so many blood & tears when I realize what freedom really is. 

Indeed, it's hard to know what freedom is unless you've lost or gained it, either way. 

Having grown up in a hostile environment with little love & empathy from nasty family members cost my faith in mankind. No matter how articulate I can be in normal conversations, I've never found trusting anyone easy. There always seems to be a conspiracy against me. 

Never has a day passed without terror. It's out of myself. I feel I'm affecting those who I deal with. I'm very sorry for that. 

I like socializing, but sometimes locking thyself in a room fares better than hanging out, doesn't it ? 

Girlfriend? No, never, I can never trust. Be myself is too tough & so wasting my life may be the necessary evil. I'm still 24. There are lots of g**d***ed stuff I've neither enjoyed nor had the capacity for it, have I ?"
I feel like I always need closure,"Whenever I mess up with somebody or something I always feel like I always need closure. Recently I was in a situation where I messed up with somebody and I said sorry but they didn’t accept it. The thing is, I know what this person is like. They’re not the type to forgive easily and I didn’t expect them to forgive me but it still hurt for some reason."
"anyone think about one situation where someone was mean, years later?","Around 6 years ago I posted a screenshot of my playlist on my Snapchat story. The picture was captioned ""girly hipster music yay"". There was some AC/DC in there. One guy screenshotted my picture and messaged laughing at me that AC/DC isn't girly. I stupidly got defensive because he came out of left field and we weren't that close. I happened to look at his GFs twitter and she posted the screenshot there as well to laugh at me. I still think about this, any tips on getting over dumb situations?"
I don’t have any hope or idea of what I will do in my life,I am a senior in high school and I have become more anxious and depressed the closer I’ve gotten to my eventual graduation. I care way too much about how people perceive me so I panic during every conversation and that just makes me more awkward which I panic over again. No matter what happens in a social interaction I walk away hating myself that much more. I don’t know what will happen to me once I have to start the rest of my life. I have no motivation to do anything in my life because of this because I have no hope for my future. I have a small group of friends but that’s only because I became friends with them in middle school while my anxiety was manageable. I haven’t had a legitimate conversation with a girl that is more than general schoolwork questions since probably 6th grade. I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to date because even if I get a girlfriend I will just panic over every possible thing in my relationship. I’ve had a job before and I technically still have it and should be going back to it but I haven’t because the thought of talking to my bosses and coworkers again stresses me out so much I just don’t want to do anything. This is why I panic over my future because I can’t live like this. Looking back at what I wrote it seems so silly but in my brain it’s monumental and I don’t know I’m sorry for the big paragraph I’ve never put these thoughts into words before.
Anxiety issues,"I started having bad anxiety after a bad panic attack from eating edibles about a year and a half ago and and after many tips to the ER over panic attacks and thinking I’m having a heart attack I just deal with it, but I constantly have heart palpitations especially at night and I’m kinda shaky at times and I’m on anxiety medication.. I was also told I have Nash liver so worrying about that makes my anxiety 10x worse it just seems like I can’t get my mind off of this stuff. Any advice I also have all kinds of physical anxiety symptoms when I’m sure it’s all in my head it’s still rough to handle and get control of. When does it get better?"
"Can’t eat even when I’m hungry, struggling to sleep","Hello. I’m a 30F, and I’ve had some mild anxiety (mostly health anxiety) throughout my life that was mostly manageable. I did have some pretty rough periods about 10 years ago, but not really comparable to what I’ve been going through lately.

Basically, I’m in a psych ward rn because after a bad reaction to antibiotics, I ended up with nightly nocturnal panic attacks that left me very sleep deprived and extremely sick over 18 nights in a row.

Since being here, they’ve been giving me a little lorazepam (Ativan), which helped initially (it’s been 2.5 weeks now) but I’m still having break-through anxiety (current dose is 0.25mg in the morning and 0.5mg approx 6:30pm) and sleep is getting challenging again. I’m also PMSIng now so that might be making things worse.

I’m getting concerned because I keep losing my appetite and eating becomes incredibly hard, constant nausea or just feeling overwhelmed when I try to eat. I’m losing weight kinda fast and I wasn’t that big to begin with. I’ve been awake now since 5:30am trembling a little and trying to fully accept the anxious sensations without judgement but I also feel so hungry and don’t know what to do. :( 

I’m trying to be strong but this is getting so exhausting. 8 weeks ago I loved sleeping and loved eating, and it’s still difficult for me to comprehend how I’ve deteriorated so rapidly. So far my doctor has been reluctant to start me on an SSRI but I’m feeling pretty desperate for help rn. Someone who’s been through something similar and got to the other side, please guide me 😢"
“Anxiety Isn’t Real”,"I need someone or *many* someones to feel me, here.  I was talking on a live stream about how bad my anxiety has been all of my life.  That I has left me bedridden and depressed and jobless.  
I have gone to therapy and tried conventional medicine for decades, TMS, Ketamine, CES, LENS, CBT, DBT, ERT, mindfulness practices, journaling, meditation, dunking my head in ice water (yes that’s a thing), mantras, manifestations, exercise, no sugar, no caffeine, no alcohol, no gluten, breathing techniques, more sleep, less sleep, can’t sleep.  

And you have the NERVE (based on blissful ignorance, I know) to tell me that it’s all in my HEAD!???
PS.  It kind of is in my head.  But it’s in my gut, too. You know, the gut brain connection?  I just started working with a functional doctor who is helping treat me based on my genetic variations that cause me to hold onto stress hormones longer than the average gal.  It’s proof, and validation.  I think better days are coming.  They have to.  I’ll let you know what works for me.
Anxiety is REAL.
And I’m sorry you have it, too."
Always feeling in the clouds,"My body is in constant fight or flight mode, I hate it. My boyfriend is starting to feel my anxiety himself and he doesn’t deserve it, why should he reassure me all the time? Anxiety is a real bitch. My father has had 4 strokes within 3 weeks and doctors tell us there’s nothing else they can do now. The first stroke happened and thanks to Covid, there were no beds available in the city who maybe could have helped him more. Just frustrated, angry and sad.

A small stray cat showed up at my back door this afternoon who was super friendly and it set off an anxiety attack for no frickin reason, like why? This little cat just wanted to say hello and get a snack. I’m here with you all who need need to vent!"
Deja Vu,"I'm just sick of this already. Ever since I took Lexapro, I think, and it made everything a 100x worse I've just been getting very strong episodes of deja Vu. 

Anyways had one today went into full panic. Maybe I'm dead and this is just my sad lonely life flashing before my eyes."
throw it at me,"i turned 31 yesterday, and have been dealing with anxiety most of my life. I smoke regularly, and have always managed without anything else. I exercise and work with kids and animals, so I’m usually happy.

I suddenly lost my mom in april and have been extremely down and sad. The anxiety mixed with depression, is heavy, so I told my doctor. She put me on Celexa and I am not interested in the slightest.

I hated the two days I tried ( I know it takes longer than that, but I had horrible bloody visions everytime i closed my eyes), so I want something else. IS THERE ANYTHING that I don’t have to take everyday that would help? I know xanax is probably hard to come by in 2021, so what’s a helpful alternative?

hopefully this is allowed, i am ok and managing…but I really miss sleeping and laughing"
Anxiety/some kind of issue with my ears?,"I have GAD, and I'm not sure if it's related to this situation. Essentially, I have some sort of problem with the backs and tops of my ears (externally, not the inside of my ears). I've been noticing it since COVID started, when masks would irritate my ears, but I think it's been an issue for a long time. Just wearing my glasses can make me uncomfortable, especially with my hair. I'm constantly taking my glasses off and putting them back on- I don't like to have any hair under the glasses, not even my baby hairs/short hairs underneath that inevitably end up under an arm of my glasses. Obviously, not wearing my glasses isn't really an option, although I do try to give myself frequent breaks throughout the day. 
I can't really describe how it feels when my glasses are in an uncomfortable position. Overwhelming, uncomfortable, but if I focus on it it's not physically irritating, so I don't think it's some kind of skin issue. It's not even that I feel anxious, I just feel like it's wrong and I need to fix my glasses and hair. It hasn't cause any huge problems, like I haven't had any anxiety/panic attacks about it, but it's a constant annoyance that just keeps getting worse. It's especially bad now because my touching all around the sides of my ears has given me a couple pimples, so it hurts every time I go to adjust. 
I'm also wondering if it might be a sensory processing issue, but I don't know much about that. 
I'm not sure if I've explained any of that well. I barely understand it myself. Any advice/insight would be greatly appreciated!"
Need reassurance on anxiety pain and a bit of a vent,"My anxiety has been very bad for the last 9 days. A change in my living situation puts me living with my primary trigger and unfortunately it's not going to change anytime soon. I've had a number of panic attacks and on Tuesday went to the ER even though I was sure it was just a panic attack because I hadn't been able to calm down in 2 days.

I am feeling a bit better now but still experiencing generally high anxiety levels that I can't get down for more than a couple hours. With that I have pain across my chest, my arm, in my shoulder and side and over my lower ribs. It's intermittent and gets worse as the anxiety gets worse. It's probably just the muscles responding to being so tense for so long.
The doctors said there was no emergency and this has been my third anxiety related ER trip this year. The first was when I learned I had it. The pain though is feeding the anxiety in a loop and I don't know how to deal with it. It's just constant. 

My doctor has me on Wellbutrin, it has helped until this recent episode, and the benzo he has me supplement with dosent help with the physical effects I think. It just makes me tired and only sometimes. 
My friends have been able to distract me enough to help when it's an attack but I can't keep relying on them and I don't know what to do about the day to day. 

I have been doing the breathing exercises my therapist told me to do. They help some.

Is it like this for anyone else? The constant worrisome pain. Always feeling on edge and tense? Is this just my life now? I just want to feel ""fine"" again."
Running as a mean to calm anxiety?,"Hey everyone! First time poster on this subreddit :) I've been running as a way of dealing with my anxiety, and it has been such a gift to me. I feel like I can actually think and be in my body when I'm on a run in a way I can't in ""real life"". I've been dealing with anxiety for as long as I can remember and I'm so thankful that people recommended this to me. Along with this, keto, and other tools that have helped me stay accountable, I feel like I'm such a great spot in my life. Some days are better than others, but it's good to have a community such as this to turn to.

Does anyone else use running as a means of anxiety relief? And what else do you do to help? I'd love to bounce ideas off of you."
Crushing pain in my chest,"First time posting here. I've had an awful week. The last time I felt this bad was 8 years ago, so it's been extra awful. Because of the stress I'm under, it feels like someone is sitting on my chest or reaching inside, crushing it. It's so uncomfortable and painful. If I didn't know it was from anxiety, I'd probably go to the hospital. I can't take my Ativan until bedtime so during the day, I don't know what to do. I can get over my other daily panic attacks and crippling anxiety but the chest pain is too much. Any suggestions?"
Struggling to find what career is best for social anxiety,"I’m really passionate about reading and writing and I’m considering becoming a teacher but I’m not sure if this career is right for me because of my social anxiety. I actually visited my high school to talk with one of my English teachers about what it’s like being a teacher and I starting shaking and having trouble breathing as soon as I saw all of those high schoolers walking past me in the hallway even though it hasn’t been long since I’ve graduated

I was originally thinking of teaching high school or middle school but based on the anxiety I felt I’m not sure I’m cut out for teaching in general, I don’t feel this type of anxiety when I’m walking around college and even around my classmates, I just feel like the high school crowd can be super harsh and judgemental and maybe that’s why I felt so much anxiety?

The thought of parent teacher conferences and interacting with parents in general also gives me anxiety, I used to work in a dental office and some parents were really judgemental/entitled (not saying all parents are like this, most were really nice but there were some that were really rude)

Are there any good and well-paying careers out there for people with social anxiety? I’m thinking of going for medical assisting or nursing but I’m honestly not sure at this point"
Had a panic attack at an event,"so i was working an airshow for my Navy cadet thing and i had a rlly bad panic attack. So i started having a panic attack in the middle of the event and my friend noticed, he said i can see you shaking so he said for me to go see the officer in charge and i tried to tell him it will pass but they basically forced me to go witch made me feel more anxious. When i sat down everybody started crowding me and putting ice packs on me because they thought i was just overheated. everybody told me to take off my blouse and my cover and started taking off my uniform and that just made it worse. i tried to tell them but they brought the EMTs witch made it even worse. they were not very nice the EMT guy looked at my heart rate and said it was abnormally high and i started to freak out at this point. I asked him if anything was wrong and he just said it was a little high. i started to panic a bit less and my HR went back down to normal and i just kinda sat their and said i was fine and tried to keep my composure.

&#x200B;

Just thought i would get that off my chest."
i forgot how hard it is to do large group activities and i am spiraling a bit.,"i just went back to this weekend program i do for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic and i’m relatively new to it. i have a handful of friends there but it was all online also year so i didn’t get to meet everyone and figure out how everything works yet. it’s a big group and it’s hard for me to not feel so overwhelmed. 

i had a pretty good time, like everything seemingly went smoothly, but i can’t let go of the fact that something just didn’t feel right about it. i felt like i always said the wrong thing, or that every time i opened my mouth i was complaining and needed to be reassured and that i was being annoying and pessimistic. or that i wasn’t friendly enough because i was so in my head and anxious and now people think i hate them. 

for example, i have a friend i really like and we talk all the time but suddenly it was so much harder in a group dynamic and i feel like i wasn’t being as good of a friend to them as i usually try to be. and i couldn’t tell if they wanted to be around me or not and i just felt like i wasn’t being entertaining or compassionate enough or something. so i didn’t even talk to them as much as i really wanted to because i didn’t want to bother them with my presence but i also feel like maybe they feel bad or like i was avoiding them? but i have no idea how to tell the difference with body language. 

like, i keep forgetting how hard and draining it all is. i literally feel so empty inside now and like such a burden and so undesirable in so many ways. and nothing bad even really happened. i even made new friends and everyone i met likes me (seemingly). but i just can’t shake the feeling that i fucked it all up and that the world would be better off without me around. i literally don’t know why but large group activities make me borderline suicidal afterwards for a few days and i can’t figure out why. i don’t even feel like a person i just feel like a shell that does whatever i can to make sure people like me and still somehow messes it up. i feel like a dumb little alien that is trying to copy how everyone is socializing. i just want it to be easy. i wish i could just be myself. i hate it."
Withdrawal help,"Currently almost 2.5 weeks off Lexapro, have been having pretty bad withdrawal symptoms. 

Wondering what other people did to help with withdrawal symptoms? Are there any natural alternatives to alleviate symptoms?"
Medication discussion: what was the most effective med or med combo you’ve tried/are currently on?,"I’ve tried a whole bunch of shit without success however I still wanna try what’s left and perhaps retry a few things. I’ve been on a few different ssris, one snri, a trycyclic, few different atypical antipsychotics as add ons to the AD’s, gabapentin, some anticonvulsants and idk what else couple other things. I’m just wondering if I’m missing something or my doc is missing something. 

Also anyone else here try a bunch of shit and not respond to anything?"
I've been having a lot of negative thoughts lately,"TW: suicidal thoughts

Should I be concerned? I've been having a lot of thoughts along the lines of ""I want to die."" or ""I hate living."" or ""I hate myself."" I don't think I completely mean it, because I don't really want to kill myself. I just kind of wish I could stop existing or having to deal with life. I'm not sure if it's my anxiety or depression, but I don't really feel in control of my life, and I come to some sort of realization that I don't think I'm ever going to enjoy life. It just feels empty and meaningless and too difficult to keep dealing with."
Is it anxiety when I forget things right after I do it?,I always get nervous that I forgot to do something like turning off my car when I leave it or locking the door. Is that just forgetfulness or is that anxiety.
"Depressive, anxious cycle","Hi team. First post… 
Does anyone else get stuck in that anxious cycle of being too depressed to hang out with friends or leave the house, which in turn makes you anxious that constantly saying “no” to hanging out with friends will make them stop asking you/hate you, then the thought of that just makes you feel so down? 
My state is currently in lockdown so that’s a good excuse to not go… however we are able to go out for “exercise” for up to 2 hours. Even then when my friends try to organise something like that I end up saying I can’t go because I’m too anxious to leave the house or too depressed to get out of my bed. 
It’s a hopeless cycle…"
Anxiety causing burning skin feeling when touched?,"Hi everyone!

About 3 months ago, my wife's mental health broke down due to an event that she found particularly traumatic. I believe it was caused by a build up over time of anxiety. 

She is now getting help from a psychologist and psychiatrist however one of the symptoms she has discovered is she feels like her skin is burning when being touched. It doesn't happen when our kids or pets touch her but it happens when I touch her, or her mother (and maybe other adults, I'm not sure).

Last night she tried to force herself to hold my hand but she could only last 2 minutes and then had to stop. She said it literally felt like her skin was burning.

Has anyone else experienced something like this?"
Really just an outstanding night,I’m in my house right now forgot to take buspirone this morning. Had a near panic attack from these loud ass cars in my neighborhood combined with these new neighbors using a chainsaw in the dark. Didn’t even use it just pulled the cord(thought it was gunshots and people screaming everyone’s dogs were barking). All while trying to do math and waiting for my dad to bring over my medicine to my moms house. Everyone’s enjoying the football games in their backyards and I’m in my house having a meltdown/ driving around my neighborhood trying to figure out what’s going on. I feel like I’m being controlled by anxiety and I’m not my true self. I’d do literally anything to get rid of it.
Will I gain weight on Zoloft?,"Recently I’ve lost 30 pounds, that I have put on from taking lexapro about a year ago. Now that I feel better about my body, my social anxiety happens to be getting even worse unfortunately. I’ve been recommended Zoloft but I am TERRIFIED of gaining weight. I really don’t want to. I know antidepressants make you drowsy and lower energy. So I need to know this information before I start taking Zoloft."
Going to ask my doctor to get back on Paxil. I’m so scared and feel so defeated.,"This next big chunk of text is me venting about my anxiety so feel free to gloss over this lol

I got prescribed Paxil when I was 15 and stayed on it for 6 years. I decided to taper off last summer because I felt like I was fine, knew how to cope, and knew the anxiety I used to feel was just me overreacting at things. I was so rational, motivated, and normal on Paxil. I knew what I wanted to do in my future, had hobbies, good grades, worked two jobs, interned, and volunteered. 

Well fast forward to me tapering of in spring 2020, I was officially done with the med august 2020… then covid got worse and my boyfriend got sick. Queue my anxiety getting heightened. I was scared for my diabetic dad. Then February came and I switched my major just as I got accepted into a university after spending 4 years at community college. I was so lost with my future.  
In June I knew I needed help and was feeling suicidal from the anxiety. I couldn’t handle it. I called the crisis line like 5 times in a month. I convinced myself I had cancer and was going into a spiral everyday. I finally started seeing a therapist late June. She’s great, but I still feel impending doom. 
Whenever I drive, I convince myself I’m going to die. Whenever I have a stomach ache, I convince myself I’m going to have diarrhea in public (anxiety gave me very bad IBS) and because of this I pop pepto bismol and Imodium like candy ruining my natural digestive process. I also have a chronic bladder problem where I have to pee like 20 times a day and constantly feel like I have a UTI and I’m going to pee myself in public. It’s ruined traveling, Disneyland, and driving long distances for me. But I feel like anxiety made this problem worse, as my bladder was fine when I was on Paxil.I have a fear of eating and have convinced myself food is going to make me sick. So I regularly just live off of toast or pasta with vegan butter and salt. 
Anxiety is creating a lot of fears for me I need to stop in it’s tracks (like driving, going to concerts, theme parks, traveling) I am genuinely considering selling my Hamilton tickets I was so excited for because of my anxiety about my IBS and bladder. 
~end of anxiety life story~

I’m just so scared to go back on Paxil. I was still me on the drug. I just was more calm and collected. The only bad thing was getting off of it. That was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. 
I’m also scared how it will affect my relationship with my boyfriend and I. I read something that said SSRIs make people fall out of love?? What??? Granted, I don’t think this will happen as my boyfriend and I met when I was on Paxil. I continued to be on it for a year, I tapered off of it with his support. Plus I love him more than anything lol. I feel so guilty sometimes the way I treat him because of my anxiety. I get so irritable because I’m anxious and I constantly need his support. I question that he loves me and will never leave me. It must be so exhausting for him. 

I just feel defeated. I was only able to last a year off of the drug and here I am crawling back begging to be medicated. But I can almost see the future of my ibs, bladder illness, agoraphobia, health anxiety, and fear of driving (I can’t be scared of driving, I live in Southern California!!) consuming me if I don’t put a stop to this soon enough. I’m only 23 I have so much left in life

Wondering if anyone has experience with this, sorry for the long write up, I don’t see my therapist until Monday and needed to vent now :D"
How can I overcome my anxiety so I don’t screw up with this girl?,"16 year old boy here. A few weeks ago this girl made it clear that she’s interested in me and gave me her number. She’s pretty cute and is fun to be around so I could really see myself growing to like her a lot. But one huge problem I have is that I never know how to start good convos. I always overthink what I’m going to say and become too anxious to even attempt to start one so I almost never end up talking to her, but she still makes it clear that she has interest in me. I’m really worried that I’ll brood over what to say for too long and she’ll end up losing interest in me. How can I overcome this?"
"Anyone else here have near constant 24/7 anxiety, but those random days or hours when you don’t, you’re instead just filled with depression over how horrible life is?","You just think what could have been if you hadn’t been cursed with this illness and the places you would have gone and relationships you could have had. I’ve missed out on literally everything in life. I’m 31 now and my entire 20s flew by and I didn’t get to enjoy them at all. I’ve been crippled by this shit my entire life. I live at home right now with my mom because I’m Fkn broke. I’ve been out of work for 3 years except 2 jobs I couldn’t hold down for longer than a month during that time span so I don’t count those obviously. I’m starting a shitty call center job that’s remote from home In 2 weeks that’s basically an entry level job for 22 year olds so why I went to college and got a bachelors I have no Fkn idea since I’ve done nothing with it and still have all my student loans to pay back. Childhood was okay I guess but I can’t even remember the happy memories from back then because my mind is so Fkn far gone I can’t think clearly my memory is non existent. All I have are regrets. I have nothing to live for there’s nothing in life I enjoy. Everything, my entire existence has been consumed by this shit for as long as I can
Remember and I’m truly ready for this to all end. Even if after death is just nothingness I’m still pretty sure that’s be better then this artificial bullshit life. I dont remember the last time
I felt an emotion other than fear or despair."
Every time I try to talk to people and make new friends. I feel like I’m ignored and everyone doesn’t like me. How do I stop thinking this?,"I recently found a great group of people through a podcast. We watch movies through discord and make jokes but, I’m so fucking awkward. I feel like I can’t even have a normal conversation with anyone even virtually and I wonder what’s wrong with me? How do I stop thinking so negatively?"
I’m pretty sure I convinced myself I have tinnitus,"Yeah, I think I convinced myself I’m hearing a sound. My hearing is great, I’ve had multiple tests done and all of them came back fine. The more I look into tinnitus, the more I hear this sound even though I don’t have damage to my ears according to the doctor. Anyone else ever convince yourself you have something even though tests prove otherwise? 🥴"
Has anyone elses anxiety increasing the past few weeks as the weather started getting colder?,"I can feel my anxiety symptoms flaring up recently. Headaches, restlessness, boredom, fatigue, insomnia, and  shallow breathing at times. Just an overall feeling of mush. 

Can anyone relate? How do you battle seasonal depression?"
No outlet,"I've got no outlet for venting or advice, I'm so fucking alone. Just finished high school and everyone I knew moved so far out of state. I have no friends stating at home, my parents don't even slightly understand my condition, and my therapist doesn't want to see me anymore. I'm fucking breaking down I'm cutting again and punching holes through the drywall. Covid making me go to stupid fucking online school so I sit in my room for hours everyday staring at this screen and I can barely make myself leave or eat or socialize or fucking anything. I'm so off putting, got no social skills, and I'm withdrawaling so bad now that I'm trying to stop smoking. I need reasons to not just off myself. I wanna feel normal. I want friends. I want the bad feelings to stop. I'm wasting away. I have nothing left and I want to die"
Can anyone relate to my anxiety symptoms,Lately my tongue feels huge and my neck feel swollen but then it’ll go away or I won’t notice when I’m distracted. I do have trouble breathing but I always have with my anxiety I hyperventilate or start to manual breathe. I’m like should I go get my throat checked out or is this anxiety. Cause my throat doesn’t hurt it’s not swollen just feels swollen
Breathing,"Hello, 

When I have anxiety I sort of feel like I am gonna faint / have low blood pressure. Like, when my anxiety is at its worst, I have to lie down and put my raise my legs.

The thing is that I do not know how to breathe properly to avoid it since I do not know if I am missing oxygen or if I have breathing to much.....

Also, wearing a mask makes it worse because I feel like I can't breathe normally and it makes me focus on it.

What do you guys think ?"
Paranoid.,"I found a post on kiwifarms. I don't use that website, I don't frequent those types of communities. They found someone by aligning what little pictures the person posted. The reflection off of certain items. It... was a lot. It was scary. It made me so paranoid. It reminded me of that man who found a Japanese idol from the reflection of her eyeballs. 

My anxiety is going nuts. I never want to gain a following. I want to go off the grid. I'm just spiraling."
Fireworks bringing my ptsd back,Just wanted to complain that's all.
Twitch in my ear,"Hello! Ever noticed how sometimes a random muscle, or your eye lids just have a random twitch during the day? Like an erratic pulse. Well, I've been having that on my eyes, mostly the left eye, but also in my left ear. I suppose the eye twitch means I'm tired, which would make sense.. But what about the twitch feeling inside my ear? Anything to be worried about?"
Work Related Anxiety,"I’m not sure if this is the right place to say this but here goes nothing.. 
Recently, I have moved into a new apartment and am a full time college student. When I first moved in, of course it was hard leaving my family, but I was pretty much at peace. Since then, I have become more and more busy with school assignments to the point where all i do is work. I want to take time for myself to just enjoy life again like before but don’t know how. Also, I now despise the apartment and constantly want to go home to my family. 
Any advice is greatly appreciated and God bless."
Headache/tumor anxiety,"I have a gad and frequently have headaches in isolated points on my head (back right and front left usually) and while I know this could be due solely to stress, exhaustion, hunger, etc. etc., I’ve convinced myself it’s because of tumors. Is this a viable concern or just another anxiety symptom?"
Panic attack,"I think I'm having a panic attack right now, what should I do? I can't catch my breath, I'm scared! My head feels so light and I feel out of touch"
Why are our brains forced to ruminate bad scenarios and hurts when we feel the bad feeling in our stomach?,And why do we have that feeling? The feeling like there was something heavy? Will the feeling decrease in frequency if I will try to stop ruminate? I do not know what fuels the feeling.
Natural medicine to cope with anxiety,"Hi,
I get really tense in my shoulder, neck and back and it gets worse throughout the day. Does anyone recommend any vitamins or cbd oil to relax?"
I think I'm going crazy,"I had a very vivid hallucination I think last night. Something was trying to pull me out if my head. Like imagine a dementor sucking your soul out. Except I couldn't move my body or ask for help. It happened four times in total. My head feels like mush. It's constantly vibrating. I'm scared. I'm scared I've either gone crazy or have some sort of spirit trying to take me. 
 I Know it's probably the first but I've had so many paranormal experiences that other people have seen    
  I've had seizures before but this feels different. I can't move. I can't ask for help. I just stay there and hover over my body. Should I try and find a doctor for this or am I just being silly? 
 I don't want to die like this."
Just need to share how I'm feeling,"I just moved to a new city several states away from where I've been living for the last 3 years. I had been feeling relatively stable the last year until the last couple months during which I went through some major changes including a breakup (from a pretty toxic person), and now a change of job and residence. I've only been in my new apartment for a couple of weeks so I'm still adjusting, but it's been tough to lose my routine and support network that I had. I don't really know anyone here and I don't start my new job for a few more weeks. All the change and the loneliness has caused my depression and anxiety to return with a vengeance and I'm feeling overwhelmed. Because I'm in a different state and now have different insurance, I will have to find a new psychiatrist and therapist after working with the same people for about 5 years. I'm struggling because as you'd probably expect, at a time when I need these resources more than usual, it's been harder to really get anything done including looking up psychiatrists/therapists and figuring out insurance. I know that it will eventually get better, as it has before, but that doesn't seem to make the present any less difficult. Anyway, I guess I just needed to express all this and hope I can get some support/positivity."
Is it normal to feel burning sensations at random parts of my body?,
I'm terrified rn,"Ok so. I've been good lately in terms of anxiety and even my family have noticed a difference. Been to therapy etc. So today this random guy I don't know texts me a gif of a guy waving. I knew he was just gonna mess around with me like one of those internet trolls, and he did. But then he replied to my questioning of who he was with ""The guy in the van. Want some candy?"". Yeah I know, I know, getting scared of that crap is childish. But I was legit terrified and immediately blocked them. Noe im sitting here almost shaking and I don't know what to do."
I don't know if I should see a doctor,"I'm not sure if I'm just being a little whiny but I've never felt this down before. My job is so stressful and I am having a lot of problem with my family. I'm a breadwinner and even though I'm just so sick of my job, I can't quit. It's eating me up. I just don't think I'm doing well in any aspect of my life. I've gained weight because I've noticed that whenever I'm sad I'm gonna grab something to eat to feel better. I'm anxious to go to a doctor because in my country there is a dilemma, mental health awareness isn't really a thing here and I'm scared that what I'm feeling is not valid at all. I tried opening up to someone but unfortunately it was shrugged off. I'm having thoughts of ending it all but since I provide for my siblings and parents, it's just hard. Thank you"
Anxiety about working my first job,I'm 17 and got my first job at a fast food restaurant. Yesterday was my first day working there and it was extremely chaotic because there was an audit happening. The manager barely helped me and I had to rely on following the other workers. After work I had a panic attack and I already hate working here. I struggle with social anxiety and this job makes it worse. I want to quit but I know my mom and my friends would be disappointed. I'm not sure what I should do.
"Anyone get anxiety about the fear of not being able to fall asleep, thereby, creating insomnia?","This is a wonderful new thing I've developed . Its really frustrating me .

It doesn't help that I'm hella jet lagged ( La to Barcelona).

I don’t want be such a rude person but I feel like I freeze up when I‘m trying to respond to a text....
Im at the hospital,"Iv got a serious infection in my body an my anxiety is trough the roof.
The doctors don't know what it is yet

Any helpful tips?"
Its Hard to Breath,"I've been having a lot of Anxiety,  I think I'm anxious every single day of my life. It's hard to deal with life. 
I'm extremely paranoid, I think it's A reflection of who I used to be. I just sometimes really wish I didn't exist."
Anxiety Feels Like a Trap,"Recently, say the past few months, I have finally started to get my anxiety under control. However, today I probably had a little too much espresso so now I'm on high alert.

It feels like when my anxiety is high it's almost the same feeling when you are high or drunk and can't snap out it. Like when you are trapped in a room or a car. That feeling kills me. It's such a helpless feeling and you just have to sit in it. I'm getting better at sitting in it. Working though it. Learning from it. But when it happens it doesn't make it suck any less. 

Just really needed to vent this out into world. Going to go clean and take a shower and do some work because all of thag always seems to help. 

Thank God for reddit for so many reasons."
"Beer is the only thing that makes me feel relaxed, and I just want to be put on a medication that gives me the benefit to function like beer does.","I understand that Alochol does make Anxiety worse in the long run, but I am tired of depending on beer just to make me give a shit about things. I wish there was a medication out there that could give me the relaxing effects of Alcohol without making me tipsy. Does anyone know what is the best Medication for me? I am unmotivated, depressed, and Anxious every time I am in a social gathering. I just want to be put on something to make me feel relaxed and content, so I don't have to have a few beers just to feel uplifted and motivated. I have tried Pregabalin, and that only makes me feel slightly relaxed, but I still don't give a shit about anything, and I am still trapped in this shell I have been stuck in for the last decade."
Anxiety Attack,"The other night I heard my mom and her boyfriend arguing through the walls of my house, he started to complain about me and then went off for about two-two and a half hours about everything that he hates and that everyone hates about me. I have diagnosed bipolar depression and anxiety and it felt like my emotions shut off after about 10 minutes of him yelling. And then after the fight my mom came into my room and tried to talk to me and my vision started to tunnel up and when I tried to speak it felt like my vocal chords were stuck, I lifted my hands from the keyboard and they started to go numb and I couldn't move them and when trying to close them it felt like all my blood was leaving my hands and they started to cramp up completely, I wasn't able to feel my skin or muscles, but I could feel my bones in my hands and my fingers. It was definitely the worst feeling I had ever felt. My mom explained to me that I was hyper-ventilating. I have to say it was very very scary and really put into perspective how your emotions can literally make you physically hurt and make you feel like you're dying. I'm posting to see if anyone has ever had this happens to them and if the feeling was the same?"
Does anxiety keep you from eating?,"Hello I’m kind of new here. I’ve suffered from anxiety when I was a little kid, but recently I’ve been struggling again. I believe it’s due to the steroids I got put on for antipsychotic-induced dysphagia. I have anxiety so severe that I’m afraid to eat. Have any of you ever had anxiety get this bad?"
Anyone else get wake up anxiety?,"Every time I sleep, be it a nap, night or whatever, when I wake up, I'm extra anxious for 15-30min, then it gradually gets better. It's like I have to learn how to be human again, lol. 

This even happens if I'm on benzos (though not as drastic).

I have no clue why this is, I can't correlate it to anything. 

Anyone else experience this?

It perplexes me and I hate it."
THE ANXIETY PARADOX (how to recover from anxiety and panic disorder),"If you suffer from any kind of anxiety, you're probably all too familiar with the ""fear of the fear"". You know how anxiety and panic are the worst feelings in the world. It's very hard to put into words how helpless it makes you feel whenever you're in the middle of a panic attack, worried it might never end. I suffered from anxiety and panic disorder for more than 4 years myself.

Exactly *because* it feels so fucking horrific, it shouldn't come as a surprise that for nearly all sufferers, *eliminating their anxiety* is their biggest wish. It definitely was for me. It is, however, this fixation on eliminating anxiety, that paradoxically keeps reinforcing your anxiety. It's like a feedback loop from hell.

I'm not a scientist, but I've definitely done my fair share of research. Anxiety is regulated in the amygdala. It's supposed to protect you from enemies, animals, dangerous situations, etc. Your amygdala, however, doesn't really function based on rational or logic. It functions based on actions, reactions and behavioral feedback. If a certain event causes you a great deal of stress or pain, your amygdala ""learns"" that that is a danger. It will then try to prevent you from said danger by sending you signals (feelings of anxiety) whenever your amygdala recognizes a potential trigger.

So how does this correspond to my claim that the recovery of anxiety is a paradox? Well, let me try to explain: Panic attacks and very strong feelings of anxiety can be absolutely debilitating. You reacted to this by fighting these feelings, trying to avoid triggers, etc etc etc. This has TAUGHT your amygdala that the feeling of anxiety in itself is something dangerous that needs to be avoided! This is a terrible thing because it makes us scared of the anxiety itself. It can turn a slight feeling of anxiety into a full-blown panic attack! Your amygdala will recognize a potential trigger, for example, a bodily sensation that you feel during anxiety or panic, and it will send you more signals to try to warn you of the anxiety! (*Oh no, I'm feeling anxious! I can feel my heart beating fast again! I can feel my stomach feeling weird.. Oh no, I'm going to have a panic attack again! I'm back to square one! All my progress has gone down the drain!)*

This can make recovery from anxiety nearly impossible. Fixating on getting rid of the anxiety is a behavior that reinforces the belief of your amygdala that anxiety is bad. It will also keep your amygdala firing signals any time you might feel a little anxious. Recovery from anxiety is **not** possible as long as we are ***anxious*** *of anxiety.*

So, how do we turn this around? Its quite easy actually. Its called doing nothing. Like I said before, the amygdala functions based on actions, reactions and **behavioral feedback.** This works the other way around too. We can literally *unlearn* our brain to respond to specific triggers, and even make it less sensitive in general. We do this by practicing acceptance. Acceptence is, in my opinion, the only true cure to anxiety. What I mean by acceptance is not fighting the anxiety. Not fighting the feelings. Not trying to get rid of whatever you're feeling in the moment, not trying to avoid, not trying to escape, not trying to distract yourself. Instead, accept. Sit with it. Float through it. Not reacting to signals from your amygdala is a beautiful thing. It teaches your brain that there is no danger! We need to teach our brain not to fear the feeling of anxiety, for that is a completely natural feeling! We need anxiety! Okay, you're right, we don't need it as much as you are feeling it right now! But still, the feeling of anxiety is not something we need to fear in itself.

This is not something that will fix you in an hour or a day. But keep practicing it. Keep sitting with the feelings of anxiety, and you will feel them subside. Don't try to convince yourself you will be okay, for that is ALSO a reaction to amygdala, and like I said before, feedback and reactions will only reestablish that it is a genuine danger, and that your brain is right in sending you these signals! Float through the anxiety. Instead of seeing those moments of anxiety and panic as obstacles, start to see them as opportunities to train yourself! Try to place your worst enemy in a positive perspective, and you will see how fast your perception changes. Everytime you get a panic attack, that’s an opportunity to teach your brain to be less anxious! Those moments of pain are the only moments where true change happens. It is definitely one of the hardest things you can do. Sadly, the only way past anxiety is to go right THROUGH it. You need to completely submerge yourself in it, and, the hardest part, not fight it. You need to look for the anxiety, even invite it from time to time. Make it your friend.

The good news is, that going through this will eventually give you a mental toughness that very few people will ever have. You will be so much stronger than anyone else you know. It just takes a lot of courage to start the progress, but I’m sure you can do it .

I hope I explained it properly, but English is not my first language so yea. If you have any questions or if you feel like you want me to expand on something please just ask! :)"
Anyone hearing voices talking bad about you? Any tip to make it stop?,"Someone I know have this feeling that people are talking bad about him all the time, insulting him, criticizing his clothes or the way he clean the house or things like that. Suffering from anxiety and it goes all the way that he cannot go out of home anymore. 

When we are together, I don’t hear the same stuff, it’s just him, that’s why I think it’s just part of the anxiety. 

Anyone with similar experiences?
Any tip?"
Afraid of dying in sleep,"So, I got my 2nd dose of covid-19 vaccine on the 23rd, I got moderna 
After I got it I noticed some weird heart rhythm, it cause me anxiety but it was gone the next day
Today I’ve had minor chest pains, and now as I was about to fall asleep I felt my heart slow down and i immediately thought that I will now die in my sleep
Could this happen? Or is it just my anxiety messing w me? Should I get a doctor or is it nothing to worry about?
Thankful for answers"
Sewing causes stress,"A few years ago I loved sewing and was apart of a group of people who enjoyed sewing historical clothing. After a painful breakup that resulted in the loss of those relationships and even five years on it’s hard to sew. It’s painful, like a stabbing sensation on my stomach and a feeling of pointlessness. I even sold or packed up most of my related possessions to avoid looking at them. How do I enjoy my old hobby again? I picked up a needle and thread to just start doing it and it’s like running uphill to finish a seam."
Laying in bed all day again,My anxiety and lack of motivation has been so bad lately the only place I feel some relief is just laying in bed. My wife is out of town today so it is just me and the kids. They keep asking when I am getting up and I am telling them that I’m just not feeling great today. Feeling pretty ashamed.
Spending sprees can hurt more than self harm,Not all the time obviously. I have noticed lately people in general don't take anxiety spending seriously. It has some very dibilitaring long term harm. One bad attack and your life can just be wrecked. So much self harm and people just don't take it seriously. Watching my spending (curse you Amazon!) To monitor my anxiety level has really been effective.
I get way to anxious over sports,"For maybe the last 10 years (35 now) I’m unable to watch sports where I want a certain party to win, unless they are likely to be completely dominant. It started out with not being able watch my favourite football team (soccer) but had now stretched to any sport where a Brit may be participating, whether I have a real love for the sport or not. 


This has meant missing Emma Radacanus win in the US Open, Lewis Hamilton in the F1, England in the Rugby, and cumulated with Joshua loss to Usyk, where I had to dig ridiculously deep to finish listening to the 12 rounds and now feel so depressed. 

This can’t be normal? In normal life I’m a highly functional professional, Ans a fair bit in my career, but sports and especially my “team” losing affects me badly!"
Work and the future,"Work and the future are a big source of anxiety for me. I’m 26 now and I feel so worthless most of the time, though all the people I connect and see in life, think the opposite of me, like I’m intelligent and “good”.

I was always a perfectionist and started  to study engineering a few years back, but it was to much for me back then and the stress.

Right now I’m doing another apprenticeship, and maybe want to go back to study next year or the year after.

But I feel so much behind in life.
I need to do an internship and just calling or applying is such a huge source of stress and anxiety for me, just a huge problem. So I suppress.
I just wish, I would improve and some day, be “normal”. But right when I think I improved, everything seems to get worse again.

I know this is life on hard mode, as I read here :)
But what can I do, should I speak with a therapist again, looking if I maybe have AvPD or social anxiety …
I just want to be better with things work and social related, so I can handle studies, work and love a good life."
Dose anyone know why it feels strange to swallow food and drinks?,Iv been having anxiety over This for a month now but every time I drink or eat something it always feels like my body fights me not to swallow it. Whenever I take a drink I’m always concerned about where it’s going same with food. Idk if it’s because I think I’m gonna choke on the food suddenly or because something has happened to me
just so overwhelmed,"(tw)my anxiety is just so bad now, i feel so useless i can barely get myself to do anything, i always try to plan productive days but anxiety seriously gets the best of me time and time again, any small inconvenience can send me into a episode of just crazy intense end of the world feelings, to the point where i think how much easier things would be if i weren’t here… i’ve tried so hard to look for help i feel like everyone’s ignoring the signs but i am straight up asking for help… i would never hurt myself but anything is better than feeling like this. as distractions i try so hard to go out as much as i can and i always feels so burnt out and restless… ahhh idk just needed to get this off my chest"
It gets better!,"Hi! So around may (when i hit rock bottom) my anxiety was extremely bad. Like so bad I was terrified to leave my room. I had stopped going to school, was over eating constantly and was also depressed. In early june my mother had decided to admit me into inpatient, but I ended up going to outpatient lol. (3 times a week for three hours each appointment.) So I did that and worked very very hard. I switched my meds over the summer and started going on walks outside. Today (September 25th) I have now been able to go back to school, go to a restaurant (been twice!) drive myself to the library and also drive to therapy by myself. I’ve been doing so well I have actually, since Thursday, graduated from outpatient and am now seeing a regulars therapist once a week. My conclusion is, it does get better! I’m only 16, but through hard work and determination I was able to start pulling my life together, and you can too. It’s not always easy, but it’s worth it."
Vaccine anxiety (not COVID related),"So I grew up anti-vax. And so as an adult (33), I still am not vaccinated. I did my research and personally stopped being anti-vax about 8-10 years ago, but never got around to getting my shots up to date.

It’s a combo of things: fear of needles, and the ingrained fear of adverse reactions - plus having a history of weird and rare adverse reactions to different medications.

Well, I’ve finally hit the bullet and have an appointment to begin the modified adult vaccination schedule. And I’m super anxious about it. It’ll be in about 1.5 weeks.

The only vaccine I’ve had is the COVID vaccine (signed up the day I became eligible), and didn’t have too bad a reaction (worst in the household, but all normal). I did have multiple anxiety attacks surrounding them, though.

Just worried about it, and know I’m going to start having worse anxiety attacks the closer I get."

Doubtful about taking Alprazolam for my anxiety/panic attacks.,"I need some help, advises from people that actually used xanax as a medical treatment for anxiety and panic attacks / and major fear of throwing up in public, and not for recreational usage. (Sorry for my english not my main language)

&#x200B;

So  trying to keep the story short and focus on the issue, I have a mild level of agoraphobia which usually starts when I go out, after few hours Im mostly alright with barely any anxiety/panic attacks but the first hours outside its really bad, with panic attacks, breathing, the sensation of the heart pounding and the worst feeling that is nauseas and sometimes when its really bad throwing up.

I went to a psychiatrist which I dont feel he was quite professional it was a 10 min appointment in which he reccomended me to take

Vortioxetine 15mg one before a meal

Alprazolam 1/2 mg 3 times a day.

When I read the diagnose I felt it was really strong for my case. Im depressed but I do not believe I have a major depressión, on the other hand my panic attacks I understand needing some sort of pills for that but not sure if thats a good start, 3 times a day.

&#x200B;

Anyway I contacted another doctor which he reccomended starting on alprazolam 1/2 mg one  before going to sleep  (Im really curious if anybody knows that taking one alprazolam before going to sleep helps the anxiety of the next day when going out?) and having one pill on my backpack anywhere I go just in case, and leaving aside the anttidepressant until I start therapy and see how major is my depression.

Any answers with some personal experience or medical experience will truly help me out making a choice about this, Im rather desperate and I need to make a choice soon.

&#x200B;

I do want to start the alprazolam choice using the option of one before going to sleep to help next day anxiety going out, but Im a bit scared about the addiction and side effects of it."
Non-THC CBD oil for anxiety,"Looking for any recommendations of non-THC cbd oil items that have helped you with your anxiety. I suffer from extreme anxiety, and more often than not, it’s been debilitating and impacting my way of life.

I have started drinking 20-30mg CBD coffee and that has seemed to really help. I’m still learning about this, but would it be better to buy the oil itself and put it in food, drinks, etc?

I’m likely to end up being on medication once I’m able to see a psychiatrist (recommended by my therapist), but I would love to go organic before diving into medication (done it before but related to anti-depressants and didnt like the side effects)."
Is there any way to stop this?,"Yeah. Anxiety. It's ruining my life. So here's the deal; I got an offer to go on a little vacation for free for a few days. (Going out of state to spend a few days with my boyfriend and his family) And I get to decide when I want to do this. All I have to do is say the word. Now anyone would probably love an opportunity like that, but my anxiety prevents me from being excited/happy about this.

I really do want to go badly, but guess what? My anxiety causes physical problems, so bad to the point I shut down and cannot even communicate for the life of me. Yep, you read right. I literally mentally shut down like a robot. Then I can't stop shaking, feeling like I'll hurl, get diarrhea, stomach pain. Ugh, my stomach just goes crazy. And it's like that the ENTIRE trip. I get no break. I end up having the worst time of my life. I'm even sick just thinking about this vacation. 

It does it no matter what I do... I can go to the grocery store or talk on the phone/video chat and get sick from the anxiety of it. I was so excited to finally get to go the beach this summer and I ended getting sick on the beach from the anxiety... and the main problem is the diarrhea. And it just causes MORE anxiety. 

It's been like this since I was a little kid, but recently it got worse. It used to be I just FELT like I had to go to the bathroom, but now I actually get diarrhea and feel like absolute garbage during and for days after the trip.

And I already have stomach problems all the time... but the stomach issues is making my anxiety much worse... and vice versa. 

I just don't know what to do anymore... I want to do things, go on vacations, or even just do something as simple as going to a store without getting sick af... I'm fed up. And I don't even know where to begin to help/stop this? PLEASE. PLEASE. If anyone has gone through this and has an effective way to help, PLEASE share! I want to take back control of my life and not constantly live in a state of fear and anxiety. 



(I also do not know the cause of it... I'm not even scared of people? My thoughts are not even running wild, I just get physically sick from it? It's weird. It's like subconscious anxiety. Even if I don't think about it.)



((And PLEASE for the love of God, do NOT tell me to get a therapist. I'm so fed up with hearing that...)"
Anxiety advice,"I’ve had bad anxiety from being a small kid. Like random panic attacks in public, troubles in school because I didn’t know how to act around people or if they felt the same way. Over the years, I’ve learned to control my anxiety in different ways and dealt with the fact that it will probably never leave me fully. 

The last year has been great. I got rid of people who caused me stress, making my anxiety 100x worse, I started a degree, I’ve met someone. But it just comes trickling back like it sees you’re happy and needs to destroy that. Over the past few weeks, I’ve felt my self slipping and had the occasional bad day here in there. But tonight I’ve had a full blown, manic, breathless panic attack and I’m not sure where to go from here. 

I’m so stubborn to the fact that I need help and taking tablets etc will help me but I just feel like once you go down that road, you’re acknowledging that you’re not good and it’s acceptance. 

I’ve tried meditation, yoga, that calm app thing. I have hobbies and pastimes that allow me some escape but I just want to feel good again. Stress free, love myself again. Help me."
Anxiety literally ruins my body,"Im a young male, often checking for apt, have no health problems and i still get palpitations, tachycardia, sweating, high blood pressure, dizziness, headaches often, everyday. Atm im on a benzo and ssri medicamentation that is helping me alot but still cant get rid off these things which are really annoying. Anyone here feel the same and got any solutions ? Will these symptoms go away by the time ? Thanks!"
Jury duty,I have jury duty Monday and I’m anxious af about it! God help me!
Anyone have any tips for calming down during an attack?,"I just wanted to reach out and see what helps quell others when they’re anxious. I have severe attacks and it will even trigger hyperventilating. 

Last night I had one of my worst attacks in a year and all of my tricks weren’t working. I had calm music, I took a lukewarm bath, made tea, tried ice cubes on the insides of my wrists and back of my neck and I just couldn’t calm down. I just wanted to reach out and maybe learn some new techniques for calming down? Help? 🥺"
"Dizzy, can’t walk, breathless. Help me fellow anxious humans.","Okay, so i’ve had major health scare issues that caused my anxiety to skyrocket. I’m a hypochondriac. After my test results showed abnormal i panicked although it isn’t that serious. Now all of a sudden, conveniently, i’m having these symptoms:


1. Constant floating feeling, feels like i’m floating even when i’m sitting down?

2. Breathless when walking and get tired. I’m more tired than usual now.

3 I wake up with heart palpitations and extreme worry. 

4. Constipation and gurgling stomach. 

Also heart palpitations while walking. 

By the way, this is someone with major anxiety. 


Anyone else relate? Please let me know! It would ease my panic."
New panic attacks,"So I’ve been on propranolol for a week now, I’m not hyperventilating anymore which I suppose is good. But now instead of having the classic panic attacks, I’m just sort of riddled with periods of anxiety where my body will tense — tight chest or tight muscles elsewhere. 

Right now my body is so tense with anxiety, I can’t relax. It’s like I can’t release the feelings like a classic panic attack would. 

So annoying!"
Understanding Anxiety," *A truly good man does nothing,*

*Yet leaves nothing undone.*

**Lao Tzu**

&#x200B;

*Bojack Horseman* is a TV show about a self-destructive sitcom actor from the 90s.

On the day of his new movie premieres, he’s torn apart by anxiety. As he’s trying to relax in his jacuzzi, his friend Todd comes around.

“Hey buddy, big day?”

“No…” 

“Big premiere day?”

“Stop.”

“Secretariat in theaters now. How exciting?”

“Please stop.”

“People are seeing your movie, forming opinions, judging you all over the country.” 

“Why are you doing this?”

“Or no, maybe nobody is seeing it? Wouldn’t it be weird if nobody saw your movie?”

“How do I get out of this conversation?”

“By this time tomorrow we’ll know if it’s a hit or a flop. The air crackles with possibilities!” 

“Oh, good lord…”

Bojack slowly drowns himself in the tub…

This is a very familiar dialogue for people with anxiety and overthinking. Our b\*tch of an inner voice constantly pokes at our insecurities much like Todd’s, imaginatively escalating our worries beyond control.

Anxiety is always unsettling. It catches us off guard, and quickly surges into overwhelming sensations. If we let it, it’ll control and consume our lives.

Now, don’t confuse anxiety with fear. fear is real sh\*t. It’s a vital reaction in face of a threat. Fear keeps you alive in acute physical emergencies, by triggering the fight or flight response. When we’re afraid, our heart rate increases, our senses are enhanced. Colors become vivid. Everything happens in slow motion, yet occurs so fast like in a John Woo movie. 

Summoned in a healthy dose, fear will give you the swift edge you need in the short term and the dedicated motivation in the long run. It shows care and concern for those you love. It allows for judgement and resolution, accompanied by energy and focus.

### “Nothing… the silent killer…”

Problems arise when fear becomes a self-perpetuating condition rather than a coping function. Instead of either fight or flight, we then get paralysis. When feeling incapable of handling the situation, we become anxious. We even start dreading our anxiety… We get anxious about getting anxious. We worry about worrying.

The root cause of anxiety is the fear of losing control. Our health, jobs, relationships, status… Everything can slip in a moment. We can never know what the future will bring. 

So, we create stories in our minds to feel a sense of control over our lives. Because if we imagine scenarios in our heads, we feel in charge. Like a kid playing with Action-Man and Barbie figures… Except in our version of the story Action-Man suffers a divorce, Barbie gets unemployed, and both of them fail to pay their mortgage!

You see, we tend to exaggerate and catastrophize uncertainties. Every little doubt turns into a wildfire of escalating what ifs. Woody Alan once wrote, “I am plagued by doubts. What if everything is an illusion and nothing exists? In that case, I definitely overpaid for my carpets!”

These what ifs never relate to the present. They’re either about the past or the future, but they still somehow feel more real than the present. Mark Twain jokingly stated that “I’ve lived through some terrible things in my life, some of which actually happened.” So, ask yourself: 

· What is bothering you?

· Does it exist beyond your imagination?

· Will it really matter in 5 years? In 5 days? In 5 minutes?

There’s a scene in the TV show *Parks and Recreation* where obsessively hypochondriac Chris thinks he’s fatally sick. After getting some tests, he gravely shares the results with his friends.

“The test and blood work came back and the news is terrible. They found nothing.”

“Nothing?

“Nothing. The silent killer.”

Our brains are wired to constantly look out for negatives. They constantly compare our situation with alternative outcomes and then tune into the worst possible one. Erring on the safe side keeps us alive. As Guru Laghima from *The Legend of Korra* says, “Instinct is a lie, told by a fearful body, hoping to be wrong.” No caveman ever died because he thought a twig was a snake. But if you ignore a snake, thinking it’s a twig, good luck ever finding a prehistorical hospital!

So nature knowingly tricks us. 

As neuroscientist Hanson says, “The brain is like Velcro for negative experiences but Teflon for positive ones.”

It overestimates threats so we can take them seriously. It underestimates opportunities so we can get our butts off the couch. 

To a healthy degree, threats are a great motivator. If you’re terrified of performing your trombone concerto in front of an audience, chances are you’ll start working you’re as\* off! And if you realize there are only 5 weeks left, you will work even harder!

The problems start when this negativity bias gets exaggerated. Overloaded by possible negative outcomes, our brains get hyper stimulated. They start building up conspiracy theories about ourselves. As Alain de Botton says, “Happiness is generally impossible for longer than fifteen minutes.”

Imagine this. 

It’s a pleasant evening. You come home and start practicing on your trombone—loving the groove and enjoying every minute of your flow. All of a sudden, doubt creeps in out of nowhere.

“What if my trombone slide gets stuck in the middle of the concert?” 

Even better….

**“**What if my trombone slide gets stuck in the middle of the concert and the maestro kicks me out in front of everyone?”

Or even better…

**“**What if my trombone slide gets stuck in the middle of the concert and the maestro kicks me out in front of everyone and then I realize I forgot to wear pants?”

Oh boy! You realize how this logic plays out like a teenage nightmare. In this sense, imagination is our worst enemy. 

See, what we really have here is not fear. Fear is always about something immediate, something that is happening now. But anxiety is about what “may happen.” We create these narratives in our heads and then surrender our sanity to them. It is like finding ourselves in a horror movie… Except we write the scripts, we hate the guy playing the trombone and we absolutely make sure that he doesn’t live for long!

If the community is interested, I'd be more than happy to share the 2nd part of this chapter in a follow up post."
Struggling with boundaries that trigger my anxiety,"My mother is proving to be a huge trigger for my anxiety and I just don't know how to set better boundaries with her. If I tell her to ease off because I'm loving overseas and have a life/things going on, I just know she's going to get upset. 
I just don't even have the capacity to deal with that outcome right now because I've been so busy with work but constantly putting her off is exhausting too.

For added context, unfortunately my mother also suffers from anxiety and I didn't know to create those boundaries when I was younger.

Any advice would be appreciated"
Want to distract myself but I'm afraid to cry/have a panic attack in public.,"So I'm dealing with some issues that really affect me and make me anxious. My mom invited me to accompany her to go out. I am debating myself if I should go because while I think distracting myself and being proactive will be very good for me instead of staying home and crying, but I also feel afraid I will suddenly feel very anxious or start crying in public or feel unable to do anything. This is something I usually struggle with. Does someone goes through something similar? What is the best choice?"
A bit of vent?,"Well the basics are that I haven't had panic attacks for a long time. Now my body feels calm but my mind is racing and showing me: You feel weird? Dying. What if ambulance will come like almost a year ago, what if this time it'a real. And I can't for the life of me stop those thoughts. Thanks for reading this far.

Also know that even if you're struggling, you'll get trough it and everything will be fine."
What to do if doctor won’t prescribe daily anxiety medication,I’m not looking for benzo.. I took them for months daily and it did help so much but I know it’s not safe.. I have PRN twice a week and it’s the only moment few hours of mental peace I get. I have tried several anxiety anxiety medications with no luck.. my doctor won’t prescribe me anything even though I have crippling anxiety. I can’t wait for a new doctor.. how can I find someone else fast..? I heard some stuff about online doctors? Thanks.
I feel like I always need closure,"Whenever I mess up with somebody or something I always feel like I always need closure. Recently I was in a situation where I messed up with somebody and I said sorry but they didn’t accept it. The thing is, I know what this person is like. They’re not the type to forgive easily and I didn’t expect them to forgive me but it still hurt for some reason."
Anxiety?,"I’ve been feeling a lot of “itching” under my skin when anxious. Has anybody felt this? If so, what helped you?"
Nervous to leave the house after being attacked two blocks from my home,"Hey guys, i live in NYC and I’ve had bad anxiety of leaving the house over the years because the neighborhood I live in is full of sick perverts. I can’t even walk one block without being hit on and it’s always by gross old men, ppl say to ignore it but it does make women anxious especially when it’s men in groups. Three weeks ago I was walking with my cousin and a crazy guy started following us and I crossed the street to go inside a salon to get away from him. When i went to open the door, he grabbed me and spit on me. We called the police and they never came, but the ppl at the salon chased him. Ever since that I’m more scared to leave the house and I get nervous about being followed or attacked. I don’t even want to go to the park across the street, my cousin said to speak to a therapist but wow they’re expensive."
I finally opened up to my boyfriend about my anxiety.,"I (22F) have been dating my boyfriend, 22M for about a year. I’ve told him before I used to have an anxiety disorder (social anxiety disorder) but have never really gone into true depth about how much that affected me and the leftover effects of it. 

For context, I had SAD as a child and a teenager. It was socially and mentally crippling for me. Constantly thinking people were judging me, struggling with my self esteem, bad physical anxiety. Etc etc. I didn’t get any help for it until I was 18/19. I went to a therapist and got CBT and it changed my life. 

I don’t qualify as fitting the DSM-5 diagnosis for SAD anymore because of therapy and working on myself. However, I still consider myself to be an anxious person. I still struggle with anxiety. And I still have to work on my self esteem. Years and years of formative experiences and emotions being wrecked by anxiety can do that to a person. 

My boyfriend and I never fight; we just get along well enough not to. The one thing he gets upset at me about is that he feels that I don’t make decisions enough in our relationship. It started out that he didn’t like that he had to choose the restaurants we would go to. So I started trying to choose the restaurants. I’m definitely doing better on that front. Then it developed into okay, I choose restaurants, but he wants me to choose activities to do as well. So I’m working on that. 

He doesn’t like that I don’t play my music in the car and we always listen to his. So now I’m trying to play my music more. 

He says he talks more than me and starts more conversations and that bothers him. I said, I’m a naturally more quiet person. We had a conversation about that. We had a conversation about how if me not making a specific decision bothers him/frustrates him, he needs to communicate with me and tell me instead of just acting mad at me and causing me to anxiously spiral about why he’s mad. 

It’s a very emotional and triggering topic for me because growing up, I was always “that quiet girl,” my mom was constantly telling me to be more assertive, and I feel like I’ve been criticized for similar things my whole life. 

Communicating about it with him made me cry because like I said, it is triggering. But I’m proud of myself for communicating. We talked about how he is going to need to work on having empathy for me in these situations instead of always getting frustrated, and how he needs to communicate more. I need to make more decisions and act without overthinking things. 

I don’t think my boyfriend is 100% right about everything he said regarding the conversation-he said I don’t come up with conversation topics which just isn’t true. He FEELS that way though, which makes it his truth and so I told him I will work on that. 

It was also hard for me because I feel like he isn’t very reassuring. In that situation, getting a big hug and him letting me know he cares about me and likes me regardless would have been what I needed. Instead, I was the one telling him how much I care about him. He shows me he cares about me so it’s not that he doesn’t, however, I’ve been trying to work up the courage to tell him I love him and these recent events make me scared to say it first. 

It is a little frustrating to me because it’s like I know I have things to still work on regarding the above mentioned issues, but it is annoying because I feel like he should be more understanding and less quick to get in a bad mood or upset about it. 

Any thoughts on going forward and strengthening my relationship?"
Need help dealing with anxiety,I was recently found out I had anxiety and I am super anxious and stressed out about it and I was wandering if there is any good techniques you guys have on helping manage calm the anxious feelings
Having even a single planned thing going on in a day makes me incredibly anxious and feel like my day is basically over. Any suggestions for dealing with this?,"Today, for example, I'm running a 3 hour D&D session for some friends here in a few hours. That's it--I have absolutely no other plans for the day. Despite that, I have this constant feeling of anxiety and dread hanging over me. I feel like I can't start something (say, get into a game or practice drawing) because I have this **thing** coming up. It doesn't matter how much I like doing the thing, or how I know it's going to be a good time.

This extends to pretty much anything that I schedule. I've tried timeblocking strategies before to add some structure to my free time (ie Drawing practice from 1pm-3pm, then gaming/chill time from 3-5pm, dinner, etc etc). Nope, instant anxiety and dread as long as there's still something 'scheduled' for later that day.

If you're also someone who deals with this, how do you work to mitigate it? I can't go through life just constantly feeling like garbage whenever I have something planned, hah. Feeling like this kills my productivity, too, because I just can't get myself to focus on other stuff in the meantime."
forcing myself to eat/ anxiety,does anyone else feel like they have to force themselves to eat food/ daily meals when having anxiety ? it feels as if it is the hardest task to do (in the moment it is) without feeling like throwing it up :/
Derealization,"Any tips on how to get out of a huge derealization phase? I’ve been in it for WEEKS, and I can’t get out. I have moments where I feel (somewhat) normal but for the most part, all day everyday feels like I’m in a simulation lol. I’m a mom too so I NEED to figure this out. It makes me feel so out of it, with no motivation to do anything like cleaning the house, going to the gym, or doing anything with my son. And it causes me to spiral into a huge panic attack that will last almost all day because of the feeling it gives me. 

I’m also on Zoloft 50 mg a day, this has been happening since before that though. Please help me feel normal again. 🥺"
Why am I so impulsive and reckless?,I was hanging out with a friend last night. Like always he wanted to make-out and blow him. I was in the mood and asked if we could do it. We ended up having sex. He is experienced but I had never done it. Like an hour after we were done I knew I fucked up. I am not on birth control and we didn't use a condom because neither one of us had one. I do impulsive stuff all the time. Now I'm freaking out for obvious reasons. Wtf? What if I get pregnant? Why am I like this?
Apparently I am breaking my dog.,"So this is my first post and sorry for mistakes, English is not my first language.
So since two months my boyfriend an I have a rescue dog but in these months where we adopted him a lot of things happened that were very unforeseeable and made me very anxious and tense.
So my dog was probably abused in some pointed of his life and is kinda anxious around humans and new places. We have a trainer for it and he has gotten so much better, but there's still a lot to work on. So yesterday the trainer talked to me (again) and told me that I was being to anxious and tense (again) so that my dog can't relax. That if I want to help him and want to make progress, I have to be less tense. Afterwards I tensed up more and now every damn time I interact with my dog I try to be as relaxed as possible but trying that I tense up even more.
And now I am in a spiral trying my best, tensing up, overthinking that ia am bad for him, then trying to do better to be the owner he deserves and so on.
So if anyone has tips dealing with a dog with anxiety while having anxiety yourself, I would be very glad for advice."
Taking a long time,"I’ve been in therapy on and off for about 10 years.  The most recent therapist is really good.  I find myself making progress in that I’m not so focused on the negative aspects of my life and am more solution focused.  That being said, I’m on these medications for depression and I’m still having days where I’m depressed.  I’m not living my life the way I want to.  I’m 32 and Gay and new to the area and I want to meet more gay people and have more friends.  My depression is holding me back from this as I don’t feel confident enough to do this.  I also don’t want to feel so stressed out about work.  I want to have a sex life and these meds make it difficult to do that so I want to eventually get off of them.  If I continue to go to therapy will I be able to accomplish these things or will I continue to have to be on these meds and live this boring life?"
"Propranolol and ""physical symptoms of anxiety"". Can you please give an example of what that ""looks"" like?","I've been dealing with pretty massive anxiety for the last 3 months.  Currently taking Seroquel and it works one day, does nothing the next.  I feel awful today truthfully.  I've kind of realized most of my anxiety is physical related.  Tight chest, nausea, headaches.  I've been reading that Propranolol is great for getting rid of the physical aspects of anxiety.  DAE have success with Propranolol working with what I'm describing?"
Intrusive thoughts,"How does one with anxiety deal with these, especially in a heartbroken context."
Hard night,"I just could not shut off my brain last night night. It was like my body was actively fighting sleep. I'm currently switching meds. I was on Zoloft for 6 months. Which was not great for me. Now after doing the genesite test, they're trying me on Effexor. I know stopping one SSRI and starting another is always not going to be the smoothest. I just could not calm down last night. I had a headache and my skin almost felt like it was crawling a bit. Are these normal things to expect when switching meds? I'm only 6 days into effexor."
Paused breathing while falling asleep,"I'm trying to post this on different subs to get an opinion.  My wife hasn't been sleeping well lately due to our nightly nursing toddler, and has been particularly exhausted.  She isn't diagnosed with anxiety but I think she has some form of it. Sometimes when she's stressed or when she's worried about something she'll get nauseous and vomit and diarrhea.  Anyways our son was having a rough night last night and  wife was overtired and nauseous, and commented that whenever she tried going to sleep, her breathing would slow down or even pause and she'd wake up to catch up.  She wasn't waking up choking so she doesn't think its OSA.

My question is, has anyone ever had anxiety or panic where they had this issue when trying to sleep?  I've been looking to see if it's central sleep apnea or if it's part of some panic attack she may have had.  Last night was the first time this has happened to her (to our knowledge)."
"Not sure if this is the correct sub for this but, I need help. I am always worried."," 

Hello. I am a 15-years-old Introvert that also has social anxiety. So I have this one friend that is a good. Me and her have known each other for years now but have only started getting closer and started chatting alot (Keep in mind this entire story does not include anything that happened in real life it's only online). So slowly I started getting used to her because we chat alot so then my guard went down and I am not too much of an introvert with her. In chat. But at times I try to be friendly with her since she always makes me happy aswell. So usually when she sends me a picture of herself and asks what I think I try to support her and compliment her with compliments like You look cute, You have a nice smile and etc. But after doing that I always just get myself worried since I feel I am being too friendly which could be a problem since I don't want her to think I like her as anything other than just a really close friend since that's not my intention here. Also at times I could apologize for talking too much since I really enjoy talking to her but I wanna make sure I am in the good side by apologizing since I am worried something wrong happens. I also apologize alot if I do something wrong because once again I don't wanna lose her, her being my only closest friend who is a girl. But then I feel worried maybe apologizijg too much is annoying and it's just a never ending loop. I also usually take no time to reply to her which I heard isnt too good to do. But I am also quite worried since school starts soon for us and she also wanted to play games together but I am not really used to talking to girls since as said she is my only close friend who is a girl And I would be so much more of an introvert IRL or in a call. Since I don't wanna be too awkward. She is an introvert aswell but less than me. I just don't always know if she started hating me or not.. It's painful. Sorry for the long story, Help if you can."
argh thinking about my past makes me super anxious now I can't sleep again,sigh
How do you stop hating on someone who has done you wrong?,"It has been more than 2 years since I have learned about the truth and I have been trying to forget about the wrongdoings of the person, however I still get reminded of it at times and I feel a lot hatred towards the person. I was deceived and taken advantage of for 6 years, I hate all the memories, moments, time and money I have invested on this person. The worst character I have ever came across and led me to trust issues and distancing from people. 

The person lacks in every way and is always envious and jealous of others success, wealth and appearance. Constantly boasting, gossiping, and spreading false rumours about people who are more superior, to feel better. Basically pure evil. I can’t comprehend how someone can plot such a despicable plan for years just to destroy another human being who has been genuine and sincere throughout. 

I was such a fool, blinded and forgiving over and over again. Please take my advice, do not take people lightly, always have your guard up and choose the people around you wisely. Quality over quantity. ‘It is better to be alone than in a bad company’ better to lose than to suffer. Don’t be afraid and stay strong x"
Fear of regrets,"Currently I'm studying but I feel like when i finish university and going to work I'll have people constantly testing me or comparing with me, and I know no one will be there for me. I don't know what I'll be working on. If I regret my job? If I just end alone working and not knowing what I really want to do? I see many people working all day every day and I ask myself wether I'll be able to handle it. Uni is sometimes just hard. There's so much people better than me in many ways that i don't know if I will be able to get anything. I'm constantly thinking wether i'll have regrets in the future and I just can't continue like this. It's a so intrusive thought and maybe i'll change my career but maybe I regret that too... 

I'm starting to think friends are important for me, despite the fact that I don't think anyone is trustworthy. I just don't like it, to think that I'm depended on other people than myself but I can't avoid it and i hate it. They won't even care about me. During this pandemic I lost some contact that I had and it made uni a lot harder. It was just me alone against the courses and I felt hopeless all the time. I could study normally up to 1 and a half semesters but now i feel so much doubts and I don't know anyone to talk about it. My parents are just losers and I think I'll end like them and my few ""friends"" are just doing their thing.  Maybe I don't deserve anything for studying and I have to earn things but it's just I don't feel that I'm ready. I don't trust myself. I was constantly rejected in school and have so much fear. I don't even think i had a childhood. I just feel faint-hearted and that no one will trust me in the future and i can't engage to anything because of my doubts and I keep dissapointing people. I'll end just like my parents and time just keeps passing by. 

I just want to run away. I just want this pandemic to get over to continue studying by inertia of seeing people doing it in the library."
Anxiety is a bitch. This advice really helped me.,"And when I say bitch I mean it in the sense that bitch is the most universal word in the English language. 

For most of my life I felt like I was Medusa. I wasn't a snake-woman hybrid, but my thoughts often felt like a mess of tangled snakes swirling around my brain with violent intentions. 

At some point, I was talking to a shaman, yes a literal shaman, and I was describing my anxiety to him, and he asked a series of questions. 

Do you blame your eyes for the things they see?
Do you blame your ears for everything they hear?

No? Then why do you hold your mind to such high standards? We can't control all the thoughts we have, but we do have the ability to choose how to respond to them. 

There are a lot of pieces of advice that have helped me over the years, but this one was a special kind of breakthrough. You're thoughts are not always your own, but your reactions always are. 

We are powerless when it comes to controlling every thought that crosses our minds. Our power comes from choosing how to respond or not respond to these thoughts. Strive for improvement not perfection. One day at a time we march towards a better version of ourselves."
Is anyone else getting super frustrated and tired of constantly feeling like your friends hate you?,"Hey guys, I’ve suffered with anxiety for years and above panic attacks above everything my biggest frustration is constantly feeling like my friends hate me or don’t like me 

If they respond weirdly or don’t use the usual emoji’s my mind instantly goes to they hate me. It’s made even worse by the fact that I always rant to them about things and I’m always scared they’re getting tired of me. 
It’s becoming so unbearable I can’t handle it anymore. The worst part of my anxiety at lest is believing the whole world and your loved ones are against you, even if they aren’t 

Anyone got any advice?"
social butterfly to recluse,"my social anxiety is horrible. i can handle hanging out with one or two people but anymore makes me so anxious and i just want to leave so desperately. it’s like these alarms in my head start blaring because i know i’m going to have to endure conversation i’m not a part of nor do i know about, inside jokes/references i won’t get and will have to awkwardly listen, etc… now im a very good conversationalist and i am in no way bad at being in a group, but i just hate being there. 

i can pretend to enjoy myself and drink a beer or something and have forced small talk with people i don’t know, but god i would so much rather be at home stress free. every time i try to hang out with groups of people i just get over looked and ignored every time and after a while i guess i’ve just developed anxiety towards groups because i feel i will be left out. now don’t get me wrong, yes they were bad friends and most friend groups won’t ignore people they bring to hang out, but there my friend is where you are wrong. they’re all the same. 

i’ve tried and tried to make friends with my peers, younger, older, anyone. everyone just ignores me. i have no friends besides my coworkers. i tried to hang out with them before and they ignored me. i hate it so much, now anytime someone asks me to hang out i get excited and then have to awkwardly make an excuse once i find out all of this persons friends will be there. and i don’t regret it. because i know if i were to force myself to go, i would hate it and be left out trying to get drunk in a corner by myself. god sometimes even the thought of having to endure more social awkwardness makes me want to cry. it makes my soul cringe. 

and i’ve tried to be that guy who starts conversation when it gets awkward but it seems no one else wants to put in the effort to hold a goddamn conversation. it makes me so mad and sad. now because of my “friends” (who also talked a lot of shit on me during said hangouts), i have social anxiety. i try to be a virtuous and genuine person but it’s just a weak spot to be exploited to everyone else. i just get lied to and tested to my limit just because it’s “fun” for someone else to see me get emotional. i hate everyone. no wonder it’s hard to find good people in the world, they all just get taken advantage of until they realize being bad is the only way to have respect. fuck this society, i don’t want friends anymore because no one cares what i have to say so all i can do is scream into the void and listen to my own insanity."
ever since school started i've been very anxious.,every morning i wake up with stomach pains and have to use the washroom like 3 times. my mom says it's anxiety and she gets it too. it makes it hard to get ready for school on time. what are some ways i can deal with my morning anxiety? i've been avoiding breakfast bc of it.
Don't have a safe space/safe person to talk to at school anymore,"For context I'm a high school senior and I'm also autistic.

I'm really struggling with not having a safe space/safe person I can go talk to or a safe space to be in when I'm having a panic attack, sensory overload or am just not feeling 100%. By safe person I also mean teacher, because teachers can often be more supportive than the other kids. In terms of safe space, like a classroom or something else.

The teacher who used to provide me this support, and did since I was a freshman just left this week and it was extremely sudden. It's been so long with his support and it feels odd without it. His last day I quite literally got home and cried (a bit embarassing I know).

I used to seek out support in the student help center that was only open to people with disabilities (like learning disabilities, anxiety, depression, ADHD etc) but that has been opened to everyone this year and I constantly feel judged there. My anxiety and autism are very visible, if something is bugging me everyone is going to know.

I just don't know where to go next. Has anyone ever experienced anything like this before? It's just really difficult to not feel like I have to hide everything away for 7 hours at school."
CT dye anxiety,"So I had a CT angiogram with contrast (so they injected a dye) on Thursday noon. I had no immediate reaction (except the hot feeling for like 40 seconds).

On Thursday night, I developed hives all over my body and had to go to ER for monitoring. They gave me Zyrtec and I was fine after a couple hours. Doctor told me it could be a delayed adverse reaction to the contrast.

I’m now worried that if I will have any more side effects. I heard it could cause irreversible kidney damage, and the delayed side effects could happen for up to a week (so I have 5 more days to get through from now). I also heard it could cause cardiac arrest; and I’m really really hoping it won’t cause that - anyone here that can help me?"
Anxiety surrounding moral choices/being a good person,"I just got to college. I used to be a really mean person and a bad friend in high school. Over quarantine I had a whole personality revamp and changed myself COMPLETELY because I wanted to be a better, pure person. I think I succeeded in that, because I got to college and was trying my absolute hardest for the first 3 weeks to be nice to all of the new people I was meeting. Everything was going well, I had even started talking to this guy I thought was cute and one of the things he said he liked about me was how caring and comforting I was to be around. This obviously made me happy because this was the goal of my whole personality change over quarantine. This guy is super nice, we weren’t in a committed relationship by any means, we were just talking. But, I fucked up last weekend. I got super drunk when I went out and ended up kissing his friend. Naturally this guy found out and I felt so extremely shitty about it the entire next day. It actually sparked a panic attack for me which made me go home because I couldn’t handle the guilt and anxiety. I ended up talking to the guy in person and we worked everything out- he claimed to not be mad and said he felt like he just wanted to be friends with me for a few days, so he was glad we were having this conversation. However, for the past week since the incident, there has been this god awful, lingering feeling of anxiety in my stomach over this entire situation. Am I a good person still? I try SO HARD to be and I feel like this one mistake set me back light years. I want to give up and literally die, I feel like the shittiest person ever and this feeling of anxiety that comes with is not helping my mental health at the moment. I still hope I’m a good person, my intentions were never to hurt anyone. Had we been in a committed relationship/set boundaries I would never in a million years do something like that."
Help me help my brother.,"Hey, so I myself am suffering from anxiety since the time I can remember, but all I heard from my parents and family members was that I feared a lot (was a coward in other words). And I thought I was like that I didn't know that it was a suffering from GAD until recently when I just wanted to die. I searched for my symptoms online and found out I had GAD. Since then I have been doing a lot of research about it ...reading books, videos , etc. 

From this I realised that even my younger brother (21) was also going through Depression. All the symptoms indicate it and he always speaks of how death brings peace. We have lost 3 very close uncles and my grandmother in a span of 5 years. We both were very young to process those emotions and I feel that is what is causing him us these problems. I tried to reach out to him many times in the past and I am actively trying but he doesn't open up . 

I  told him what I was going through for that he was very supportive and insisted on me going to therapy and all. But when I even straight up told him that he too had Depression, he just ignores it and says that he doesn't. But I know for sure that he does because he keeps taking about death and he doesn't go out , doesn't have any friends and I have never seen him laugh. He is cranky a lot and keeps hitting walls and breaking stuff. 

I even told him to go to a therapist and sent him sources to cope up but he's not following those. It's like he doesn't want to be helped and just wants to die. 

After all this I don't know what to do now, my mother is very religious and believes this is all black magic and Satan's doing. 

Please help me help my brother. I love him a lot and I don't want to see him suffering like this.

Sorry the post is too long but I would appreciate any help I get ."
How do you guys stay grounded in social situations?,"Hey everybody! I’m an introvert, HSP, and I have an anxiety disorder. It’s always been energetically draining for me to be around people and to be out in the world, even (sometimes especially) when I’m with people I like and doing a fun activity. I just get over-stimulated, which zaps my energy and can trigger my anxiety because I start having thoughts along the lines of, am I going to be able to get out of this situation before I crash/etc. I usually just muscle through it and then go home and collapse.
Especially now, in this COVID era when I don’t have as many opportunities to flex my social muscle, I feel the weight of having to go out of my comfort zone and do social things. On the other hand, I want to be a person and maintain my relationships! 
So, do you guys relate to what I’m describing at all? What tools do you use to deal with it?"
Panic attack in class,"Yesterday morning in class I said something and my teacher snapped at me out of nowhere. 

She had asked a question and I said that it was vague (because I always try to answer the questions and participate in class but it’s difficult to answer a question if I don’t know what she’s asking) and she snapped at me saying that I had been “coming for her all morning” and “muttering things under my breath” and that I’m done talking and I had no idea what she was talking about. I tried to say that it was just a vague question and I don’t know how to answer a vague question but she cut me off and said “no we’re done.” 

I tried to stop myself but I was only able to hold back a panic attack for like ten seconds. As soon as it started she told me that I should leave the classroom (and my friend asked a minute later if she could come out to check on me and she did). I ended up going to the LRC (the learning resource center) to calm down. (I had taken the SAT and ACT in there because I have extended time and frequent breaks and the person who proctored my tests said that I could come there if I was feeling overstimulated in school). 

Anyway I haven’t seen that teacher since yesterday morning when I had the panic attack and my friend told me that she’s going to talk to me next week. The only thing I can think of that could’ve set her off is that I said earlier (in a very polite way) that something she was doing may not have been the best thing (she was messing with my friend who also has anxiety about stuff that was important to her, the same friend who came out to check on me).

I don’t understand how either of these things could have caused this reaction and I’m a senior now but I’ve had a relatively good relationship with this teacher since tenth grade. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to handle the situation?

(I put this under need a hug/support because I guess needing help/advice is needing support)."
Please tell me I’m not the only one who panics after a conversation with someone.,I have a conversation with anyone and I instantly after the conversation has ended feel anxious that I said something wrong or didn’t come across as interested or I gave off a bad vibe. Today I bumped into my brother in law at the supermarket and after walking away instantly felt my chest tighten in case I came across as awkward 😢
Severe Anxiety After Incident,"Hello guys! 
I’ve always suffered from anxiety but I somehow managed to keep it under control. 
This month my dearest cat, my little kid, my everything, almost died 2 times and we had to run to the vet to save him. He hasn’t recovered fully yet, but he is better now. 
I spent all my savings and made some pretty big debts to save him and now I find myself struggling with a HUGE anxiety anytime I am alone with him. I always wonder if he is gonna get ill again, where will I get the money from to save him, how am I gonna get to the vet in time and I know it’s all in my head but I just can’t control myself anymore..
Did anyone experience something similar and if so, how did you manage to get over it?"
Psychogenic tremors,I felt head tremors twice this week I think due to my anxiety. I feel the tremors in my hands and chest sometimes too. Is there anything I can do to treat these tremors naturally? Do they progressively worsen? I'm due for my second covid shot in a few days and concerned now because of the head tremors. Anyone else get these tremors?
I hate getting flashbacks from things that i don’t want to remember.,Does anyone know how I can forget about it
Anyone experienced with benzos here? ( A doctor would be appreciated),"What does drug half life actually mean? 

I am prescribed xanax and this month I switched to klonopin. I take it as needed but sometimes I take it everyday for 1-2 weeks and then quit for a month. 

Everytime I quit xanax 2-3 days later I get this weird insomnia but it goes away in a few days nothing too serious. I read that xanax half life is pretty short and this is why the withdrawal effects are more severe. 

This time I am prescribed klonopin which has a 3x times longer half life. So does this mean that if I use this drug for a few weeks and then quit the withdrawal effects will be mild to zero since it's in my system for a longer time and it tapers itself more slowly?

Thank you can't find any answer anywhere else."
Klonopin & Buspar,"I have been taking Buspar for several years now for anxiety (now 15mg 3x a day) and it works wonders. However, due to an upcoming situation I have landed in the hospital twice in the last 2 weeks with severe anxiety attacks. Yesterday they couldn't get my heart rate down even shooting me up with Ativan. So the hospital doc put me on Klonopin twice a day (.5mg) to get me through the next month. I took it last night and slept fantastic, but have been up 2 hours now and still ""hungover"". Is this normal??

And has anyone had trouble getting off of it after using it short term??"
I always mess up,Im in high school. I wasted my whole school life doing nothing and just wasting air. I decided this year if participate in things more. I have bad public speaking skills. I don't study well. I cheated this whole 2 years of examination. I decided I'll do smt so I participated in an internship for whichs interview I failed( for vice president and other positions) I do think I'll do well if I get a chance and ik I'd be a good leader my slef esteem is just destroyed. Anyway I had a model UN assembly in our school and I wanted to give my name and we had interviews. I messed up so bad I stuttered so much so so much. They teachers even laughed. Ik I failed but I'm so mad I thought I could do smt for once in my life. I feel so worthless I didn't even answer their questions properly. I can't even do my best. It's not like it's my first time giving an interview I did so much better before even. I even dissapointed my friends cause when I'm comfy with them I come off as too rude and aggressive. I ahte being looked down on but all I can think abt is everyone I meet looking down on me. I'm so done with everything.
Does anyone have tinnitus or any chronic ear problems?,"For like 10 months on and off I’ve been having ear issues. Chronic sore ear pain or stuffy ears 24/7. Crackling and popping when I swallow. And a thumping in my ear from the muscles. Also I’d wake up with slight tinnitus every morning that would get better as the day went by. Also sometimes I’d feel a pressure change in my ear and tinnitus would start up but would only last for like 30 seconds then go away. Lately I fell it’s been getting worse my ears not only hurt but feel more sensitive with loud sounds my ears vibrate now or crackle and sometimes I feel the muscle spasm in ear as well. I’ve been really depressed about this. I going to see a ENT I really can’t take this anymore, does anyone else have an issues like this?"
Dissociation. I don’t think I can live long like this,"I feel hopeless. I’ve been suffering from anxiety disorder since college. Last year, I’ve started suffering from a bad health anxiety. I started having panic attacks. Then just recently, I started having this fear of going insane. I started dissociating which makes my anxiety/panic worse. I feel like I’m losing control and that the reality is slipping. 

Now, health anxiety and dissociation when combined are the worst. I go from thinking I’m going insane to thinking I’m going insane + probably because I have a tumor which I know I don’t because I had a normal brain MRI a year ago. Still, I’m eager to get another brain MRI just to be sure. 

Also, I’m always light-headed. My head feels empty and also heavy almost all the time. I feel like, I’m only half focused/aware. When I walk I feel like I walk weird and that everything is fuzzy. And when I read, I have to try harder for the sentences to register in my head. I mean I understand them but I forget them right away. It scares me so much that the panic/anxiety is almost constant. Any slight movement can trigger my anxiety. So far, I never had hallucinations. But this combination of extreme fears is making me feel like I’m gonna go insane. It’s so exhausting and depressing. I want to give up on life so bad, I can’t take this anymore. :( can someone please give some advice? I’ll be starting my meds tomorrow. It’s for anxiety and depression. I haven’t told my doctor about dissociation because it’s just recently."
When did you know you have anxiety or panic attacks?,I also suffer from anxiety and panic attacks and I want to hear your stories. It makes me feel as if I am not alone in this battle. Thanks
//TW SA. Nightmare vent,"I needed a place to vent this out since my gf is in college and everyone in my house is asleep.

Huge anxiety and stress at new work assignment. How to handle?,"Hi all, I work as an IT data specialist consultant at a consultancy firm in a western European country. Now currently I am one week into a new assignment where I'm seconded to a company and it is absolutely making me mentally stressed out (even now on the weekend constantly thinking about work, ruminating all the time, not being able to sleep, highly emotional) to the point that it is making me physically ill (headaches, waking up with a knot in my stomach, fatigued etcetera). It is my second assignment after having been seconded about 2 years to another company.

Now personally, I think there are a number of factors contributing to this.

- First one is probably the biggest and is within myself, in that I'm quite anxious by nature and new job situations are always tricky to me unless I know that the job at hand is one that I can handle 100% with my skills or I can at least get by with a bit of learning. This anxiety is something I'm planning on getting professional help with, but right now that anxiousness is all too prevalent and not helping.
- Second is that the (first) project I was put on at this new company requires knowledge of a tool unknown to me. I am the only specialist that is going to work on that part, so I don't really have someone to work with who can guide me. Also this project has a tight deadline that I doubt I can make under these circumstances. I think my seniority in this was overestimated, since it's a whole new game as oppossed to what I did before.
- Third is that even with this project going which is already probably hard to complete by the deadline, a flock of people is coming to me to ask me to help on their projects, which is also a lot to handle.

Now I'm feeling shit the whole time, even when I'm off of work. I told my manager at my consultancy firm the problems that I was encountering and also the stress and physical symptoms it is causing me to have. He was very understanding and trying to accomodate to make the new place work for me. He also said that they'd stand behind me and that if things didn't work out, they would search something else for me.

This made me feel a bit more relaxed for a while, but after that it has been non-stop worrying and feeling bad again for me. Now I'm quite worried that if I go on like this, it will have longer-lasting effects on my health.

As I see it now, it's just too much for me given my current mental state. Is it too much to ask from my employer to take me off the assignment and find a more fitting/easier one for me? Given that I've been a good, loyal and hard-working employee before. Never sick, making the clients happy. During this time of an easier assignment I want to go to a psychologist to handle the anxiety I have, to avoid these things in the future.

This has become a bit of a rant but I'm just kind of losing it here and am afraid of my mental state right now..."
Advice needed for partner's imagined medical anxiety. [Potential medical trigger],"I (M40) am married to an anxious person (F36). She is anxious because of an abusive childhood, and it manifests in a lot of different ways. She does a lot of catastrophizing and the worst is her imagined medical issues. She will stub her toe and think it will result in her having to have her leg amputated which will result in me leaving her which will result in her death, etc. Her main trigger is imagined cancer. 

If her shoulder hurts, if her side hurts, if her chest hurts, if she has period cramps, if she has a headache, etc. anything will make her think it's secretly cancer and she is 100% going to die. We know that she behaves this way as a way to protect herself, to keep her ""alert"" of a threat. We also know some of the anxiety might be alleviated by regular physical check ups, but of course we're American and thus don't have health care. (She also has some issues with medical situations/doctors that also causes anxiety.)  We are working on the doctor situation, but I know that won't solve everything since we can't just go to a doctor for every bruise and stomachache.

She loses a lot of sleep every night fantasizing about how she's dying, how this is the last four hours of her life, how I'll react when I wake up to her dead, or how I'll react if she has to go through cancer treatments, etc., etc., etc. She knows she shouldn't think about stuff, but she is incapable of turning off her brain. She will obsess about things for days, and then the cat will playfully bite her and she'll obsess about dying from a cat bite for the next few days until the next thing captures her imagination.

She is already in therapy, and she has specifically talked to this therapist (and other, past therapists) about this issue. So far, none of them have given her any useful ways to deal with these intrusive thoughts. She is also incapable of googling how to fix stuff like this because just googling stuff will implant a new fear into her head. (I'm sure some of you know how it is.)

What can I do to help? What can she do to help? There are nights she gets very little sleep because she's up all night thinking she's having a heart attack or whatever, which only makes her anxiety worse when she has to get up early for work, etc.  It is really stressful for me, too, both because I can't help, and because I feel like my partner isn't present because she's obsessing over imagined illnesses.

Any help is appreciated, thanks.

PS this is my first time posting here. If there is a better place for me to post this, please just let me know."
Not so fun story,"I been having anxiety and depression problems since my early teens (28 now) and for the past few months felt better than ever with no meds or anything until I injured my eardrum few weeks ago...
I can handle pain quite well that was not a problem, not fun either but manageable. The real horror started with vertigo (got an inner ear inflammation because of the eardrum problem that gave me constant dizziness, lightheadedness and nausea) and of course my old friend anxiety kicked in and been having constant anxiety and panic attacks since then.
After the ear cleared out i had chest tightness and tingling in left arm, so I freaked out even more and went to A&E, and after blood samples, x rays of heart and lungs everything was in perfect condition so the doctor told me it's my anxiety.
I felt better the same day, but then in next few days i started filing tingling in my left cheek, and last night tingling in arm and face got worse, started getting worried and panic attack kicks in wit a headache and shortness of breath and trouble concentrating on whatever people are telling me in that moment so I  make another trip to the A&E with the same result (but without x-ray or mri because doctor was so confident it's just stress and anxiety, as he explaind me if it was something more serious, i would loose muscle feeling so my face would droop, and I wouldn't be able to move my hand).
 I had million panic attacks and anxiety issues over the years but they've never gave me such physical symptoms that lasted for days and weeks, so whoever is reading this, go and check yourself out definitely - but don't panic, because if you think it's your head it probably is."
Really struggling with anxiety right now after a night of drinking.,"Hi all. I don’t normally drink a ton. And tonight I may have had 4 drinks the whole night. That said even then my sleep isn’t that interrupted by it and Id generally go home and pass out and wake up the next day. 

Right now is very different. And I’m scared. 
I can’t sleep for more than like 15 minutes at a time. My thoughts are racing so fast they don’t even feel like mine. When I was dreaming my thoughts were also racing so fast it felt like the characters within my dreams were all malfunctioning. Without the auditory hallucination piece it literally feels like I have multiple voices in my head all trying to follow their own train of thought. And I’m ping ponging too and from every thought that comes up. Like I have no control of my thoughts. 

Is this typical for anxiety? What is this? It feels like I’ve lost some major sense of control, or like I just snapped. Like I’m about to being taken over by other personalities or something. It took some effort even writing this and staying focused."
"I have a guilty secret that if my parents find out or anybody I know, I will not be talked to and will lose all trust. It’s eating me alive.","To get down to it. I unfortunately had “Phone sex” in my case, meaning just texting the other recipient dirty texts and they wanted to send nude photos but I never sent any in return. Which most people do, but if my parents found this out, they would stop talking to me entirely, be extremely disappointed, and my distant family as well would stop talking to me due to beliefs so telling them to get this off my chest is NOT an option AT ALL. I now think that maybe the other person would tell their parents which would tell mine or it would leak out somehow. It’s ruining my whole mood and it’s clear to see. I’m freaking panicking. I want to get a therapist to help."
How do I handle the anxiety when posting on social media?,"Every time I posted on social media I feel like I’m being judged by other users. I mean I *crave* to see people’s reactions yet at the same time I’m also so nervous that I cannot stop checking my phone. And every time people are liking my posts- I feel so excited yet at the same time anxious that I cannot stop checking my phone (or even thinking about it). I’m prone to think something may be wrong with my posts if someone’s seen my posts yet they are not liking them.

Is there something wrong with the way I see social media? How do I stop feeling this way- how can I be more confident in expressing myself- even online? And by social media I’m referring to something like Instagram- I have no idea why I don’t feel nervous at all when posting on Reddit- probably because nobody here knows me? I tried so hard not to care yet this feeling is not going away."
I'm worried I'll never overcome agoraphobia. Feeling down & looking for advice/support.,"So I bought a book the other day that use low-intensity CBT techniques to treat agoraphobia. I've been slowly working through it and I'm feeling positive but it's only been a week & things take time.

Today I was supposed to attend a family gathering but even with taking my anxiety meds (which usually help), I still couldn't leave my house.

I just don't know how I’m going to move on from this current state of anxiousness. I used to be a relatively social person who’d study, go to work, see my friends regularly, travel by myself & take random trips to places.

Three years later (i.e. Now) I’m a shell of myself, I have no friends, I can’t work due to anxiety & other MH conditions & my future doesn’t look bright if this continues.

If anyone’s reading this who’s overcome agoraphobia, how did you do it? Do you have any advice?

Thanks in advance!"
Tinnitus and Anxiety Flare Up,"24m. Have had GAD and T as long as I can remember. T was generally mild and never paid attention to it. GAD could occasionally get bad and cause symptoms. But never worsened T. 

A week ago, I noticed a slightly new T sound. No idea what causes it. Sent me into a full panic questioning everything I did leading up to it, trying to figure out what caused it since I don’t listen to loud music, work in loud areas, or game on loud volume. Recounting every single noise I heard leading up to the morning I first noticed the new flutter pitch. Needless to say, I became hyperparanoid about EVERY sound I heard at home in ways I never have. I hear annoying high pitches from fridge and Xbox fan I didn’t used to hear, but idk if it’s because I’m listening too much now or what. I also think I’m interpreting random tv sounds on broadcast as having an annoying loud high pitched ring. 

I’m scared to do anything. Unfortunately have to wait 12 more days to see audiologist. In the meantime, I’m afraid it’s only downhill from here. I’m scared to use an electric toothbrush (not sonic), electric razor, drive, do laundry, get a haircut, etc. the hundreds and hundreds of google searches and Reddit searches have only made my feelings worse. Wear ear plugs when driving. Oh wait, another post says not to! (I drive a 2000 sedan. Not the quietest thing in the world but I’m sure it’s better than some louder trucks or utility vans). Am I over sensitive? Is it the anxiety? Will I decline to the point I can’t watch tv or cut my hair? It’s so much to think about!

I’m not on medication for anything."
Visual disturbances with anxiety?,"Hi!

So this past week has been really tough for me. I started to notice some visual disturbances last friday. I’ve been having floaters, flashes, and then my peripheral vision is like static/ fuzzy and shaky sometimes? I’m just curious if anyone else deals with  visual disturbances or not. I’ve had myself convinced I have a brain tumor or something due to these symptoms.

I don’t really have any other symptoms along with the visual stuff besides dizziness, which I’ve been dealing with for a few years now, so nothing new there. I have no idea why the first thought when i’ve been having these symptoms is something in my brain but the anxiety i’ve been feeling is insane. I’ve wanted to go to the ER a few times, but with covid I’m nervous to do so, and i’m just nervous in general to find out anything potentially bad. I just try to reassure myself it’s my anxiety but then my mind starts wondering what if it’s not your anxiety, it’s a crazy cycle. I figured i’d post here and see if anyone can relate or has dealt with the same thing."
Idk what to do,"I have a Monday thru Friday job and I recently applied somewhere else for a weekend shift, today I was supposed to start training at 6am, well I got there and was like 12 minutes late I saw allot of cars there and my anxiety started kicking in I just kept driving back and forth deciding if I should go in or not and guess what I didn’t go in I was so nervous and anxious as I was going to be the only one late there for training so I emailed my manager to tell her I was not able to come in due to a family emergency but she has not answered yet and now I’m Nervous all over again contemplating if I should just tell them to withdraw my application because if I do stay I’m going to be the only one doing training next week due to me not going today I literally hate myself for overthinking so much I regret not going in earlier fuck my life"
I've had enough,"I'm done with it all. For two and a half years I've been stuck in an anxiety loop that I can't break. It's a health anxiety and if someone told me I didn't have this condition with 100% certainty, I would be so happy and it would stop. The problem is, there's no way to test for it and give a yes or no diagnosis. I've been tested for it and told that I likely don't have it, but I still experience the symptoms out of nowhere and the only people that I know have these symptoms are the people that have this illness.

It's epilepsy, and it scares the shit out of me. I had two seizure incidents as a child. I have tried so hard to trust the doctors and the experienced medical professionals that have dealt with me but I still get symptoms. I think that it's going to happen at any second, so I get scared no matter where I am or what I'm doing. I can DO things, but I do them because it's a necessity and have to rush home. If I try to enjoy things like walks, films, music, video games, there is this constant slow burning anxiety underneath that is telling me that ""it"" could happen at any moment. If I get the symptom, that's it, my day is done and I'm on my bed all day waiting for it to happen.

I've gone through four different SSRI's, anti anxiety medication, therapy, exposure therapy, a healthier lifestyle, I stopped drinking two years ago, I have zero caffeine. But still, it persists all day everyday. I cannot give anything any attention, I have this loop in my head ALL day EVERYDAY, 365 days a year. I've also tried just ""letting it work itself out"". Nope, does nothing. I was told to be kind to myself and if I needed to spend days or weeks doing nothing then to do it. I did it, it didn't help.

I haven't been able to work for four months, because my anxiety has now manifested in to completely physical symptoms. I've been able to rationalise my thoughts, but the anxiety still wrecks havoc on my body. I don't get palpitations, racing heart, fast/slow breathing. No, I get the stupidest symptoms ever. I become instantly fatigued, like I've been hit by a truck of exhaustion, my eyes are visibly heavy, I go pale, I look physically sick and my legs go like jelly, like I'm narcoleptic.

I've now recently purchased a blood pressure machine, an oxygen meter, a blood sugar reader. Because I'm trying to diagnose myself with something, because there's something happening with me physically and I'm convinced of it. There is no joy in my day, the person I was a few years ago has gone and been replaced by someone I do not know. I'm scared of everything, I'm a idiot and all I want to be is a functioning person who contributes to society.

I've resigned myself to the fact that my life is going to be like this until I die. Because no matter how hard I work, no matter how much I put it, it doesn't make a difference. It doesn't make the tiniest dent in how I feel.

The doctors are out of ideas other than depression and anxiety. I'm out of ideas and I'm becoming numb, you could tell me I'd die tomorrow and I'd feel that it was deserved because all I'm doing is wasting people's time and energy.

Fuck you anxiety, you've ruined my life, you've fucked everything up."
"If my resting heart rate is usually 60. And I take 10mg of propranolol for anxiety before a social situation or before a presentation, how drastically will 10mg drop my heart rate?","

Things I did to help with my anxiety,"So i think more than a week ago. I posted about having this anxiety and how i get bloated then it would lead to not being able to breath then would lead to an attack. Its a vicious cycle. 

I did some research and read an article on having a healthy gut. Something about mind gut connection. Anyways I started drinking probiotics. It took about 2 weeks before I saw some improvements and now the bloating is lessened. I don't know if its placebo but my mom noticed it as well. That my tummy isnt as big as before. There is still some bloating but not as bad as before. I also watch how much food I eat. More veggies too. 

Then I also started using this app. Helps with meditation. My bpm is usually high. Too much thinking, stress etc. 

Im on my 6th day today using this meditation app and my bpm is on the 60 to 70 resting. This was hard for me to achieve before. And also it helps with sleep. Even without meds my bpm is at 68 to 75. Small steps i keep on telling myself. 

Had an anxiety attack a month ago but still feeling the effects. The fear is still there. Once in a while it creeps in but its more manageable now. I bought this herb that I will try and will update you on its effects. Suppose to lessen anxiety and stress. Till next time."

It was really bad.  The only reason I stayed was to take care of my kids.  It never got better, I worked opposite shift of my wife and kids, and the company was tough to work for.  I have had a lot of jobs, but this one takes the cake for worst job ever.  I was treated like garbage.  Despite this, I stayed for a year.  I survived 2 rounds of layoffs,  got promoted twice, then demoted.  I was targeted,  belittled,  and beaten down by my boss.  I'm writing my resignation letter today!!!!  After a year of job searching,  I finally accepted an offer!.  It's far from my dream job, but it's a step in the right direction!  When I finish working out my notice period, I am going to feel so free!  I already feel better knowing that there is an end in site!"
had my first day of school yesterday,"i’m in junior year now and i went back to school yesterday. luckily i only had to go for one day and now it’s the weekend but i seriously don’t know how i’ll survive the whole year. 
i feel like i just can’t do it.every single little thing is stressing me out so much, the presentations i’ll have to do, teacher asking me questions, the people there, eating in front of everyone, stomach rumbling in class, the clothes i wear, worrying about smelling bad, or if i didn’t brush my teeth correctly, or if something gets stuck in my braces, or my hair getting greasy after 12 hours of washing it, or forgetting my stuff etc. 
and as if it wasn’t enough i live about an hour away from my school, and with traffic it’s like an hour and a half to get there in the morning, and like two hours to get back home. i feel like i’m just wasting my time when i could be planning what to do the day after. 
i don’t know how to manage all this stress. i had medication but finished it and my mom refuses to buy me more because she thinks i don’t need it anymore and i’m doing better. it’s been like 5 months something. i don’t know what to do about it"
Overbearing parent,My mom is forcing me to ask my teachers to get there letters of recommendation in the next 7 days. That’s a completely unrealistic thing for me to ask seeing that they originally had 20 days. I am terrified bc I will have to ask in person and it took me three months to gain the courage to ask them for the LOR in the first place. I am more scared that in anticipation I will have some sort of nervous breakdown and end up hurting myself
In a wedding today,"I’m a groomsman in a wedding today and I’m anxious. I’ve been in a handful of weddings in the past (including my own), and each one I literally had a panic attack standing up in the front of everyone during the ceremony in the church. I always stuck it out but inside I was panicking, heart racing to 160, sweating, etc. 

I have this fear of being in a spot where I know there is no escape at the moment, and if I try to, everyone in the room will stare at me. 

I need some advice! I am considering drinking a little before the ceremony, or taking a Xanax (obviously one or the other, not both together)."
Benzo only when necessary.,"Is it okay to take 1mg benzo whenever I am about to enter an anxiety inducing situation like exams , social events etc ? Or is this is a bad idea."
Loud noises ? Triggering,"My whole family is on the zoom chat and they’re so loud and it’s driving me crazy. I’m already feeling really anxious and they’re all so loud and screaming talking over the camera. I feel even worse now, my legs are shaking and I’m trying to breathe through it- my stomach is also turning. How do I stop this… does anyone else feel loud noises are a trigger sometimes or make it worse ?"
If anyone has cardiophobia read this,"I suffer so badly with heart anxiety mainly because I get palpitations a lot. After having about 5 ecgs, chest x ray, a 7 day holter monitor and maybe 5/6 blood tests since the start of last year and being told it’s all anxiety related I started to take upon myself to do some light exercise. 

With the encouragement of my counsellor and boyfriend, I started doing walks. It was only for 3 mins at first, then 5, then 7/8 and then I walked 1.09km this morning which was amazing for me. It took 12:56 minutes. I had a smart watch on me and started using it on my walks and all along my heart rate was normal and not going so high (I thought all along it was). Highest I think I seen it go on the walk was 140bpm. That’s so good for a 23 year old. 

I advise anyone that was like me fearing to even get their heart rate up. Start off small and build yourself up that’s what I did. Hope this helps someone 🤍"
Help please,"Has anyone experienced strange smells and cold feet that start panic attacks? I know it sounds ridiculous but I’ve had a strange scent that comes and goes and sends me into a frenzy as I’m sure there’s nothing there and it’s as if my senses are heightened x 100
I also get extremely cold feet despite being in sweats / having socks on"
How to handle a new situation?,"I posted a day or two ago about a doctors appointment that I’ve made for tomorrow, which will be my first in yeaaars. Does anyone have any advice for how to prepare anxiety wise? I already feel quite nervous, and I don’t want to be shaking and freaking out the whole time I’m there. How do you prepare for appointments like this?"
Coffee?,"So, I feel like coffee used to trigger my panic attacks due to the caffeine in it. I've stayed away from caffeine for a whole year and am interested in trying something again, just wondering if anyone has issues with coffee and anxiety?"
Most effective technique for social anxiety?,"Hi, I have been suffering from moderate social anxiety since I am a teenager. I decided to give CBT a try. I want to ask for advice on how to start.

CBT consist of different practices (relaxation techniques, working with thoughts, exposure therapy, self-compassion, etc..), and I wish I had time to explore it all, but I don't have it. 

Based on your experience, If you can recommend me doing only one thing, what would it be and why?

Thank you in advance 💚"
Need advice/help!,"Hey all

I have just turned 21 (M). I study at University and I'd say I have a good amount of decent friends. I'm nice guy but I have always struggled with all sorts of relationships. I struggle with anxiety though, and where I am right now,  we are in lockdown for our sixth week. I have been overthinking everything, in particular my social life, dating life, whether I will end up alone and whether I am wasting my youth. It's gotten pretty bad, and I just can't relax. I don't know whether this worrying is useful or not, aka whether this is a genuine worry.  Its keeping me tense, anxious, and unable to relax. 

I'm thinking of making a doctors appointment and trying medication (I've tried therapy before). I am seeing a psychotherapist currently, but we haven't really discussed this, should I discuss this more with her? What should I do? Am I in the right subreddit? My biggest worry is that I am wasting my youth - I feel I don't have enough friends, that I'm not attractive and that I don't go out enough.

So what do I do? I cant keep going along like this?"
Xanax. Anxiety is ruining my life.,"I’ve posted here like 10 times. Thank you to all who have taken the time out of their lives to respond.  No, I haven’t taken the medication yet. I wish I Did. Just don’t have the courage. 

Okay I’m gonna make this as short as I can. I used to take Xanax(as prescribed) but it’s been a couple years and I’ve been living in an anxiety induced hell for 2 years. I legitimately don’t even know what normal feels like anymore. All I know is what I feel now isn’t. I’m a stranger in my own body and head. I have all the physical and mental symptoms of anxiety you can imagine. I kept thinking “I woke up like this one day maybe I’ll wake up normal”. But I didn’t. I’ve always had your more normal anxiety. But this, this is some next level shit I can’t escape and haven’t for 2 years. I’m not even able to be a father to my nearly 2 year old. I don’t leave my house and when I do it’s a mental battle and I feel like the world is caving in.  

Long story short I said, my bad. I got put on Xanax again to get me out of this rut. Once I’m able to function I’m getting on something more long term. I’ve let this eat me alive. I can’t escape this hole alone. What can I expect when taking the Xanax? I really don’t want to freak the fuck out and have worse anxiety. I’m trapped in this cycle because my anxiety is so bad I’ve convinced myself that medicine will make it worse so I don’t take it and just suffer.  But what can I expect while taking it? Initial onset? I hate any type of “high” and i especially don’t want to be “high” and anxious. I basically just want to know if this will give me relief without freaking out. 

Sorry for the language if it offended anybody. I’m just at the end of my rope and want to be normal again and be A father."
"After having my first panic attack, I’ve realised I don’t really have any friends.","I had my first panic attack and was taken to the ER by my father. I was all nervous for my exam but excited too. Thirty minutes before the exam, I experienced what felt like death. In the ER I was assured by the others that everything was fine. After taking a few medications, I was alright. However, none of my friends checked up on me. I hoped that after having recurring panic attacks for three days and not attending college, somebody would notice. I feel so frustrated knowing that i’m the only one who cares."
So anxious that my body won’t let me eat or sleep,"Hi Everyone,

My dad is in the ICU on a ventilator. Needless to say, I am anxious beyond belief. To the point where I can’t eat or  sleep at all. And TMI, but I’m having what I call “anxious pee’s” where I feel like I need to go to the bathroom 24/7, even after I just went.

Im already on lexapro, but im wondering if there’s something stronger i can ask my doctor for. Has anyone else ever had to ask for extra anxiety meds during rough times?"
Anxiety symptoms ruining my life,I feel tension inside my body and I get spasms all over it. Don't know what to do to relax.
Health Anxiety? Used to sleep the whole night w/o night sweats a month ago. HELP ME PLZ,"(24,F) I moved the country from US to UK a year ago, August 2020, to be with my husband and haven’t been able to start work yet or drive, so I have time to sit at home and be worried about everything and moving countries is a big change. 

I don’t know if I’ve begun to develop ANXIETY but a month ago I started worrying about lumps in my neck and my appt to get the covid vaccine (put it off twice) 

A few days later, my lower right back started aching really deep while sitting in a car(dont remember feeling anxious at the time), got meds for UTI that took the back pain away on day 5 but came back on day 7 my last day of my meds but even worse pain came back extending to the top of my buttcheek(worse when sitting down) & I started googling and it mentioned cancer & I started freaking out and I think that made the pain worse for weeks and started having more symptoms after googling things (night sweats). Went to the doctor and they did blood tests(normal) checked my back & neck, couldn’t see anything, and put me on the long waiting list for general physician.

Since then, I’ve been having cold night sweats that wake me up every night at 3am(some nights worse than others) and feel wide awake but no reason to be sweating, lower back pain(turned into a burning aching feeling), and recently been having random hip aches, stomach rumbling. 

But my whole life I’ve been a deep sleeper and slept the WHOLE night. I haven’t slept the whole night for the past month due to back pain & soaking my pajamas in the night and realllly miss sleeping the whole night. 

Just got my FIRST VACCINE yesterday and didn’t look at the side affects (bc I knew I would get them if I looked) and haven’t felt anything) besides the continuous back pain which now radiates up my mid back and night sweats. I’m really hoping the night sweats and back pain go away now that my fear of the vaccine is over. Anyone else think this could be anxiety? 

Really don’t want to get on anxiety pills but waking up from night sweats/back pain for a month straight worries me. I’m not having nightmares(that I know of) but can you have night sweats from purely being stressed out this long?

How could your back start aching really bad while sitting down in a car? Torn muscle? Really don’t want to start a job feeling like this!"
Heart rate is lowering,"I have an Apple Watch and it’s been giving me more and more Low Heart Rate notifications in the past month. I’m not athletic at all.

They started to increase these last days and my heart went as low as 40bpm during sleep. Which is a record breaker for me. It used to stay between 45-50

As of writing this it’s registering 59bpm

Should I worry? I’m extremely afraid that I’m gonna have a cardiac arrest during my sleep.
I also started taking zoloft (25mg for now) 4 days ago but idk if it’s affecting it or not.

Anybody had similar experiences? Any suggestions?"
I’m so anxious rn,I cheated on an exam today. It was 25 questions and I answered it in 10 minutes. Im scared the computer will detect that I cheated and I’ll get caught. My friend helped me and maybe the computer caught that she was going through her answers at the same time. I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it. I’m in college and they take this stuff seriously. I’m so scared I’ll be dropped from this semester. I’ve seen a therapist who suspects I have GAD. It’s been hours and there’s been a pit in my stomach. I can’t stop shaking and crying while I think about it. I know I get anxious over a lot but it’s never been like this. I wanna rip my brain out of my head. I’m so scared right now. What if I ruin my life and my friends?? What will my family think? How can I even calm myself down. I don’t think I can sleep. I regret cheating. I feel like I’m about throw up.
I just called 911 for a panic attack,"Well.. I’m embarrassed as can be. Panic attack got bad enough that I called 911. My heart was going faster than ever, I was so dizzy, I couldn’t breathe. By the time the ambulance was about to be here I was fully aware it was just a severe panic attack. 

I can’t believe I did that, but I felt like I had no other choice. Has anyone else done this for panic/anxiety?"
Overwhelmed,"I’m a full time college student and got diagnosed with RSV after being out of school for a week but I can’t rest /relax because I keep thinking about all the assignments I missed ,stuff I’ll have to catch up on,and exams I’ll have to retake when I get back. I also left my instrument in the locker when I was there last and haven’t been able to retrieve it so I missed out on a weeks worth of practice time. I was already struggling before I got sick, and now it’s worse. I constantly get sick and it was like this all through jr high and high school and it took a huge toll on my mental health and now it’s happening again. My anxiety has always been bad, but it’s heightened in these kind of situations. Idk how to deal with it all."
Anxiety causing me to convince myself I have a brain bleed/tumor,"As ridiculous as it may sound, a short while ago while I was at my computer I felt pretty dizzy. Now, this was at around 2:30 AM and I'd been looking at my screen for a long time. No symptoms before tonight however, and it has gotten worse since then further scaring me. There's been some on and off pain in my head that comes with the dizziness but I'm not having coordination or balance problems as of now. Any advice would be great because I'm bordering on a panic attack now."
Thanatophobia,"Trigger warning.. death.. 

I know I titled this thanatophobia. But I don’t think I have the phobia. It’s just something that scares me. Just like every other person. 

But I just need to vent a little..
I am absolutely terrified of dying. Not the act of dying. But just of being dead. Once you die you’re just nothing, for the rest of eternity, it’s just blackness. And that part there just absolutely terrifies me. I don’t ever want to die. 

Yeah, I know, you won’t even know you’re dead. But the fact is, I won’t be living this life anymore. I won’t ever live another life again. I won’t be enjoying hanging out with family, or my pets anymore. Or enjoying the sunset. Or the new cool games/movies they’ve got coming out every year. 

I will sit up crying for an hour because I can’t stop myself from thinking of this stuff. 

Thankfully this fear doesn’t stop me from living my life, but it does absolutely scare me and raises my anxiety through the roof when I actually let myself sit and think about it. I’ve even had panic attacks because of it. 

Life just isn’t fair."
Effed up dreams all I can think of now so annoying and felt that feeling where you go from sleepy to anxious like a switch being flicked.,"Another marvellous day in store no doubt anxious and stressed and just so much anticipatory anxiety no different from yest I guess but certainly feels it. Still gotta keep pushing through or the alternatives are much worse, insanity or suicide or both I suppose.  Hope you all have a good day!!"
Anxiety symptoms?,My anxiety and stress has been very high recently and when i try sleep or even during the day i get these mini brain zaps and tinnitus. This normal? i suffer with health anxiety so overthinking what could be possibly wrong.
How do you remember to breathe?,"TW: mention of self harm

Had a stressful situation today and couldn't remember any positive coping skills in the moment--all I could think of was inflicting physical pain. Managed to get home and hold off and talk with my husband instead, but it wasn't until much later this evening when I realized I could have at least tried some deep breathing and yoga to help stop feeling so fight-or-flight-y and then be able to concentrate on work. How do you remind yourself to breathe in those moments?"
Gosh someone help me,"It’s like i can’t breathe normally i’m always worried bout my heart and worry something gonna happen, but a part of me tries to be optimistic. I’m currently on Lexapro (3rd day), and don’t know how i feel about it. I just want help i feel like i’m fighting for my life everyday everysecond but i wanna live i wanna get through"
Mild brain zaps with anxiety?,I aren’t on medication or coming off them but my anxiety and stress have been high recently and when i try sleep and occasionally just during the day i will get them. Anyone else?
What are you stories and symptoms?,"Hi everyone. I’m a 27F who’s had a terrible time since April of this year and I feel defeated. I need guidance. I need true reassurance because I can’t believe all my symptoms are anxiety related.
In April of this year I had a minor surgery to drain a cyst - totally unrelated (or maybe not?) during recovery I started to feel my first symptoms: tingling legs with restless legs. I’d never felt this in my life so I went to the ER, thought my antibiotics weren’t sitting well with me. I had my heart checked and blood word - was told it’s anxiety. 
About a week later I was grocery shopping, felt a sharp pain in my left arm that travelled to my chest and it was painful to breathe. I drove home in a panic, had my first ever panic attack once I got inside. Everything was numb and tingling, my face, body, my hands were curled up, my lips curled up, I couldn’t breathe, we didn’t know what was happening so my boyfriend rushed me back to the ER. Checked my heart again and was told it was a panic attack. A week after that my chest had a constant burning pain for a couple days, went back to ER and was told my chest wall was inflamed - prescribed naproxen for 10 days. The tingling in body continued on and off during this time and after. I felt better in the sun in the summer. Beach days were my favourite, I felt happy and my symptoms subsided. Symptoms would come and go throughout summer though. I started getting really cold - freezing. Doctor requested blood work. Everything was normal but my B12 level on a scale of 138-620 pmol/L was 192pmol/L and iron on a scale of 5-250 was at 30. I had been googling my symptoms during this entire time, scared to death I have MS. 
Palpitations, leg twitching, heaviness in legs and pins and needles in feet when driving. Last week I had an appointment with my GP for a full neurological exam. I passed everything. My doctor said because I had an MRI in February of this year and it came back clear (along with me passing the neurological exam) MS was highly unlikely. I brought up my B12 and Iron levels being low and my lifelong stomach issues maybe not absorbing these vitamins being the cause of my neurological symptoms and my doctor told me not to worry about those because they’re still within range. She then told me it’s anxiety and she’d like to put me on medication and therapy. I feel defeated because I don’t know how anxiety can cause these symptoms. I was diagnosed with situational anxiety as a teenager but that was just heart palpitations and nausea - nothing like this. It’s like my mind won’t accept anxiety for an answer and I’m almost praying it’s the low vitamin levels and nothing more serious. I feel helpless, I want to feel normal again, not worry about my future and present symptoms. Has anyone else had a similar situation or even a similar B12 situation? Anything helps.
Thank you so much for reading"
Please can someone help with my feelings of guilt?,"So I have OCD that is linked to feeling guilty if, for example, I had a compliment from someone about something, I’d have to think to myself ‘well others have whatever they complimented too and a lot have it a lot better/nicer than me’. I also feel guilty as I have some good friends, travelled, although I have had my fair share of negative things to balance it out, eg: a rocky family life and don’t have much money so currently still live in my family home in my late 20s, which has resulted in a lot of difficult times over the years, have some health problems and never experienced romantic love despite being in an almost 3-year relationship. Ive also experienced difficulties including bullying amongst other various things. 

I just can’t shake this guilty feeling which might have stemmed from having a brother who has never worked and my parents giving him stuff and letting him get away with all sorts as ‘he’s missed out’. As a result, I’ve put up with a lot of bad treatment over the years. 

However, I overall enjoy where I live, I have a job in the sector I want to work however I’m just currently in an admin role and not making much money. (I have to justify having this by repeating to myself that it’s ‘just admin’ and ‘not that well paid’). Basically, just that others have a lot more than me. I also feel a bit anxious as I have ended up in a sector which I wanted to work in, which again isn’t a big deal as obviously I’ve made decisions and choices to work in this sector based on what I chose to do at university etc., and this is the same for anyone with a goal of being a vet, doctor etc. 

I just want someone to tell me I’m being ridiculous, I don’t have that much and shouldn’t feel guilty? I’d really appreciate the advice, thank you."
"i moved into my uni dorms and i’ve never experienced this much anxiety before, what do i do","hi, i’ve had some panic attacks before due to some old bad memories but besides that i’ve never rly had other problems.

now that i’ve moved into college i’m suddenly filled with dread and now i’m thinking anxiety is just overtaking me. every second of the day i’m thinking about how i have to go out and be social, how the communal bathrooms are so uncomfortable, even trivial things like exhibiting bodily functions scare me. i’m also thinking about changing majors and like idk it scares me bc my future is just not certain anymore and that’s so so scary

i start class monday but every time i think about how i have to walk over, my stomach turns and i lie in bed in pain thinking im absolutely pathetic for having a weak body :// i fight to get up and i end up feeling fine after walking for a bit, but that initial moment is scary because i feel like i’m going to puke in public

it’s been a week and i still cannot get adjusted… i think i’ve also been down with stomach flu or something so I threw up the first few days and I’m continuing to feel queasy. 

it also doesn’t help that i’m not very social but everyone around me is just so energetic and i feel my energy just getting sapped. i’m so done and college hasn’t even started wtf

sorry this is all over the place idk what to do. is there anything i can do to just. calm myself down or something. i’ve been feeling suffocated and i couldn’t breathe well a bit ago and i feel so pathetic but i have to get over this ://"

"Did you spontaneously start having anxiety attacks, or did they begin by rooting in some form of trigger/trauma?","Strangely, I never had anxiety attacks until this past year as a sophomore in college. Ever since my first one I can recall from November of last year, they seem to be getting more frequent and inhibiting over time, and it’s been frustrating trying to pinpoint a possible cognitive/psychological association behind them.

Earlier, I almost crashed when my heart rate spiked while driving, and I felt like I was beginning to lose my perception of reality–like I was watching myself die and accepting of the outcome.

Few people in my life know about this, and I think it’s time I finally tell my parents in case something worse happens next time."
Are these symptoms of an anxiety attack?,"My hands were cold
My hands were shaking
I couldn’t stop fidgeting my legs
I didn’t have the appetite to eat
I kept drinking water even though I wasn’t thirsty 
I started crying in the middle of class
How severe is this?"
Would taking a semester off college be a reasonable decision if college is making your anxiety extremely bad,"Ever since I started my second year of college my anxiety has gotten to a level where it's rly negatively affecting my life. I'm always nervous, always getting chest pains, always acting weird and scared, I've gone on meds, my friends convinced me to start therapy, I've had 3 anxiety attacks in the past week. And it's pretty much all because of my college major. 

I'm a CS major and for some reason I rly hate it and it makes me nervous as shit. I've tried to suck it up and get through it, but I just don't know how much longer I can handle it. 

I wish I was normal and could just fucking do stuff without panicking. But for some reason I'm not normal and I just can't. 

In this sorta situation, would it be reasonable if I took a semester off college to focus on my mental health and revaluate everything. I feel like I should stay in the CS program because it's secure and safe, and I should just be in school in general. But it's making me feel awful. So I dunno what to do."
I've just called an ambulance for the fist time during a panick attack.,"Ive had panic attacks for 10monthd but this time i thought u was done for real.

Everything was fine. My heart is healthy as possible. Apparrntly

Im so ashamed"
Leaving home is too much for me,"I can’t leave my apartment without thinking someone is going to sneak behind me, or try and talk to me. I have such bad anxiety about just leaving my home. Anxiety about forgetting something important, about being put into a awkward situation. It happens all the time to me. Someone will make a bad comment to me, or try and be too friendly, and I just want to be invisible. 
How do I overcome this fear and be confident?"
Suicide,"I always wondered how people could go through with committing suicide, I never understood the feeling of not wanting to feel something anymore so much to the point where you would take your own life. I have been dealing with anxiety for the past 2 and a half years and it just keeps getting worse. Im 18 and i have no health insurance i just applied for medicaid hopefully i get approved so I can get help. I do not want to go out like that it, urks me on the inside thinking that it is the only way out when I my real self knows it isnt. ive been strong my whole life through whatever i always told myself gods got you youll make it through the storm and i always have but anxiety puts up such a fight. my mental health is deteriorating im losing hope but i know deep down that this can change but i dont know if its enough to keep me going. this shit is horrible."

Afraid to be home alone? Tips appreciated!,"Hi all! Me (19F) and my boyfriend (21M) moved in together at new apartment about 2 months ago, and we left my bike sitting on our second story balcony, we figured there was no way that anyone would be able to get it down from there. Well, a couple weeks ago we had a friend over and we were talking pretty loud, and the walls are pretty thin in our complex and my boyfriend suddenly stops and said “did you guys hear that”? We all kind of thought nothing of it because as I said the walls are thin and it honestly wasn’t really anything too out of the ordinary, so we didn’t really bother checking. A couple hours later we walked our friend down to her car and there was a ladder on the side near our balcony which we thought was crazy because we had been talking about that, and we look up and the bike was gone. Ever since I’ve been afraid to be home alone (especially at night) even though I logically know they won’t come back or break in but my anxiety is getting the worst of me. At first it wasn’t too bad because my boyfriend and I worked basically the same schedule, but I since quit that job and am now home a little more often, usually without him and he works closing shifts. Some days are better than others but I’m really starting to get sick of the fear because it’s almost unbearable and quite frankly just annoying. And I just feel so stupid that I’m an adult who’s afraid to be home alone. I’ve been thinking about getting a dog but other than that I’m kind of out of ideas. Does anyone have any tips on how to deal with or get rid of the fear and paranoia?"
Please be kind!,"You never know what others are going through.  


What is wrong with people nowadays??

Last June I had a minor surgery and immediately after I started having chest pains. I went back to my surgeon and he told me there were no complications so I should see a different doctor. The chest pains were pretty often, about three times a day. And this isn’t like a small sharp pain like a muscle cramp. It’s to the point where I have to lay down in a fetal position and just wait it out and I have an extremely high pain tolerance. 

In July I was put on anxiety and depression medication because my doctor thought it was just from anxiety. (Only mild depression). But, it didn’t stop. They stopped happening so often but I get one about once a week now. I’ve been living with this for over a year. I went to one of the best cardiologists in the state and he couldn’t find anything physically wrong with me after several different tests. 

Is this actually anxiety related? Is this what I have to live with?"
I don’t know how I’m feeling,"Sometimes I feel alright and like I’m living with my anxiety pretty well, but then a lot of the time I just feel awful. I feel bad bringing this up to people in my life because I feel like I’m bothering them and have nothing to complain about since I live a pretty privileged life and stuff. I’m just tired of feeling so overwhelmed and exhausted by every little thing I worry about so much of the time."
I don’t like eating close to others,"A friend and I bought fast food and ate on some steps but he sat right next to me, pretty close, and although he’s my best friend and my roommate I just felt uncomfortable while both of us were eating and sitting that close. I said “would you mind moving over a little” and he said he didn’t wanna block the stairs too much and I mentioned that I feel uncomfortable sitting too close to people when eating sometimes. He knows I have anxiety so I explained a little bit but I feel like I offended him as he was pretty quiet for a while after that. 

I feel like it isn’t all the time or with everyone, but I don’t like the thought of someone eating and talking and possibly spitting into my food, I start thinking about contamination or eating pieces of their chewed food while I’m eating mine. 

Is this something other people experience?"
Anxiety keeping me from playing video games,"So with my anxiety it’s been really hard to read, which aside from struggling to read books is difficult because the video games I’m playing at the moment are very text heavy. Video games are typically some of the best anxiety reducers for me so I was wondering if anyone has any advice. I already 100 percented a few platformers that I played instead to try and ease myself back into it and I just want to get back to what I really enjoy."
My therapist told me something that blew my mind,"I was expressing how I’m not even scared of what my anxiety says I should be scared about, I’m just scared of anxiety itself. I have anxiety about having anxiety. And she told me, “most people only find out they have anxiety because they end up in a hospital thinking they’re dying… it’s completely normal to be afraid of a feeling like that.” It blew my mind. I always viewed anxiety as being stupid. Like I felt stupid for being afraid of something so simple like walking into a grocery store, but really, it’s not stupid. It’s a terrible disease. You’re valid in your fears. I love y’all, stay strong in your battles ♥️"
Upping dosage,"Hi everyone.. question.. at what point did you notice you needed to go up on lexapro or another anxiety med? Did physical symptoms come back? I just upped my dosage, but I haven’t felt a change yet.. when I first took 10mg of Lexapro I started feeling better the next day. I’m on night 2 of 20 mg and my anxiety feels worse :( any advice"
"20M, seeking advice","Hey y’all,
   First time poster in this subreddit, long time lurker. I’m writing this because I’m seeking advice and/or suggestions on what I can do to turn myself around.
   My initial thoughts of how my dark thoughts and outlook on life started is when my parents got divorced around the time I was 7. Leading up to around my HS graduation and even sometimes now, my parents would leave me in the middle of their situations and use me as leverage in court hearings. My parents have been very heavy drinkers ever since I can remember and one scarring even that I remember from my parents is when my father threatened suicide by cop while I was in the house during one of his heavy drinking phases. Till this day both of my parents drink heavily and I feel little to no remorse for them anymore as I tell them that their bodies will no longer keep up with the abuse. 
   My HS school years were not horrible as I had a girlfriend from grades 10-12, all star athlete, worked a part time job, and graduated top 10% of my class. There are several things through HS that I regret and wish I could turn around: 1) Get my License(still don’t have like a dumbass) 2) getting a girlfriend. My girlfriend and I had several breakups, countless arguments, and continued the relationship for way longer than we should have. We broke up on bad terms and it is something I regret to this day, but more emotions would spark if I apologized rather than leaving it be and letting her live her life. The breakup occurred around the middle of my senior year and shortly after was my first experiences with marijuana. 
Following my breakup, I took a look at myself in the mirror and hated what I saw. I am 6’3 and at the time of the breakup I weighed 270 pounds. Currently, I am 185 pounds and have maintained this weight for several years now. I thought by losing the weight I would gain confidence and energy, but this hasn’t been the case. This led to my marijuana abuse in my freshman year of college. I made friends, memories and quite a bit of money through weed in my freshman year but it drained me even more than the weight loss. Leading into my 2nd year of college, I quit using marijuana for about 6 months and as a result I lost all of my friends. Through this period, I had a lot of trouble maintaining my anxiety(something I should see a therapist about) and just finding things to do or enjoy. 
   I would consider two people my friends and they aren’t even people I can talk to about anything an can rely on for advice. I have trouble relaying my thoughts to them in fear of them not understanding my circumstances or just simply not caring. I find it hard to find people with similar interests as me in my area. All of my HS peers seem to either be engaged/pregnant, brainwashed by Leftist-College propaganda, or trying to become the next big social media influencer. I become very lonely when I can’t share my interest in a certain subject, talk about commonalities, or drive around and go do something. 
   Currently, I have just started my junior year in college and am quitting marijuana again, but not because of abuse of it, I just feel the need to quit uplift my mood. I know I should probably seek a psychiatrist to pinpoint my anxiety and NEED to get my license as it makes me feel like a complete failure that I don’t have it at 20 years old. I feel like a idiot for even writing this, but I have no one to talk to in regards of advice and wanted to get all of this off of my chest. 
   I just feel like I have wasted the past 6 years of my life and will end up like my parents. I would like to enjoy the feeling of not being an outcast or loser in my mind again. I have never seen suicide as a solution to any problem and I would hate to see myself become addicted and brain dead through antidepressants, but I feel like the things I enjoyed in the past to reduce stress just make me more frustrated and annoyed with life. 

(If you have any other questions feel free to ask because I know this isn’t the best format or use of punctuality/grammar. It’s just hard to express my feelings into words)"
[19F] with separation and relationship anxiety. Could use some advice :),"I have the most amazing and incredible boyfriend [18M] in the entire world. We have been together for 15 months now and I love him with everything inside me. I have never felt this much love for someone in my life. The longer that we have been together, the more I’ve realized how much I want to spend time with him. If we could hang out every day, I would honestly be the happiest person. 

When we aren’t together, I have this crippling separation anxiety. I’m okay for about 24 hours without seeing him  before I develop the physical symptoms of anxiety, resulting in nightly crying sessions and a stomach that’s tied up in knots. 

I didn’t realize how insecure of a person I am until i realized how head over heels I love I am. He said no to hanging out today so he could have a family night and I immediately started blaming myself thinking that maybe something I said earlier has made him not want to see me. I’m so afraid that if I’m overly affectionate or overly romantic that he’s going to stiff arm me (even though that’s something he’s never done before). So I’ve caught myself pulling away from him and that is the last thing I want to do. 

Does anyone have any advice for me? How can I cope with this anxiety?"
Strange jolt/zap feeling when falling asleep,"Hi everyone, 

I’ll start off by saying that my sleep schedule is absolute shit at the moment. I feel like I use my phone in bed so much because I feel like I’ll starve off the anxiety so I’m sleeping around 3am and these incidents make it so hard to stay asleep. 

What I’m experiencing is weird , you know that gorgeous feeling just as you’re falling asleep, I’ve been feeling like zapped out of it. Sometimes I feel like I can’t breathe and my heart starts pounding, other times it feels like a switch in my brain saying “nope wake up”. It’s hard to explain. 

It’s incredibly annoying and strange - the most bizarre thing was yesterday, it literally felt like someone hit me in the head. I always worry that this means I won’t be able to sleep again but I always fall asleep in the end. 

Is anyone familiar with this? Maybe it’s the mixture of anxiety and sleep deprivation?"
I went to therapy for the first time yesterday. i did not like it at all.,"It was GROUP therapy. there were other people.

 here's how it went.

 People were going around saying introductions. When it came my turn, everyone looked at me. i HATE it when people look at me. it's the worst.

 I Tried to say my intro but it was so hard. I didn't even have to say that much stuff. Just like 3 very simple things about myself. But I still couldn't get the words to come out. like. it felt like my body just wasn't letting me. i just said ""i.. uh... um.."" and i felt the tears coming to my eyes. so I just cried in front of like 15 ppl and just got myself to say this,""i cant talk"". 

I had a panic attack too.

I feel so stupid bc of this. Everyone else there was so friendly and they seemed so.. extroverted. they talked a lot... And i'm the fucking loser over here that's so anxious where I can't fucking say what my name is! I couldn't say anything at all ! I dreaded the whole time. I hate this.

 they had to put me on meds bc of how high my anxiety was. started the meds today and they're extremely effective and are said to do something in a couple of days 

&#x200B;

I want to leave  that therapy group forever. I don't wanna ever come back."
I CAN NOT TAKE THIS ANYMORE..IM TIRED OF FEELING LIKE THIS AND I HAVE NO SUPPORT !!,I am struggling with severe anxiety and panic attacks. I feel like my family doesn’t support me at all. I always get the “just calm down” responses from them. These are my in laws considering that my actual blood family (my mom; my dad passed away) responds the same way as well. I am having a hard time with day to day things… even going to work. I do my best to hide it but today I really broke down. And the responses that I am getting are hurting me even more. “Oh my god…why are you crying now?” “What’s wrong now?” “I don’t know what to say anymore” These are the people I look towards for support because they are the only people I have. I don’t have any friends which is sad at my age (31). Sometimes I just don’t have anyone to talk to..or be a friend….I feel like I am on my last straw here with my panic attacks and anxiety…..I feel like I am crying out for help with no support besides myself…..I can’t do this anymore…..
Everything is getting to be too much..,"I’m not too sure anyone will see this, even if no one does, I just need to get this out of my brain. 

My family has known for about a year my mom has stage 4 colon cancer. 2 days ago she took a big step by having a surgery to have the tumor removed. But they also noticed it’s spread more into her liver than before. And a week prior they had found nodules on her lungs as well. The doctors are trying to decide on if they should put her back on chemo (one of her doctors thinks they should and the other disagrees saying it would be too much for her body to handle). Or just let it ride it’s course and give her the best life we can with whatever time she has left. 

My sister has been a huge help in taking care of my mom and being at the doctors with her because I work 2 jobs and she lives at the house with them. I’ve called out of work before so I can be there, but then work gets upset if I’m gone too much. And then I feel guilty for my sister having to do so much and I feel like I know nothing on the situation because I don’t have the chance to be there. But then I feel bad not being at work or work gets upset I’m not there. Trying to be with my family, work 2 jobs, and try and just maintain some sense of balance is getting to be so hard. I have no motivation for anything left in me. I want to be helpful to everyone, but I also just want to be alone so badly. 

I’m not sure what the point of this was. I just know I needed to get these words out, but I have no close friends to talk to. So I’m sorry to anyone who had to read this. But if you did read it, I truly thank you and I hope you had a good day today."
How to stop thinking worst case scenario?,Or at least slow them down
"Really bad Hypochondria, have tried absolutely everything. What more can I try?","I \*only\* get healthy anxiety as a result of physical pain. I recently had a 24 Hour holter monitor done, a bilaterval leg scan thingy, a chest CT, to check for a pulmonary emoblism or DVT because I had a slightly elevated (95) d-dimer level and they all came back clear. I had my heart checked out 5 years ago and there was some benign anomaly or some sort. I've had other sorts of tests before too, a breast ultrasound even though im 23, and i think the thing i think is chest pain is fibryocystic breast stuff.

I don't have the kind where you think  you have some type of rare disease when you stub your toe. I think I have a heart attack constnatly, because I get jaw and left arm pain a lot and breast/chest pain on rare occassions. Now that I've gotten that d-dimer level back, which was just because of a routine check-up screening, I've been just a wreck.

I was voluntarily hospitalized and stayed there for 2 months at one of the best facilities there is. I appeared to get better, but they did nothing to help my anxiety, I begged them for help and no one did anything, I'm not even exagerrating. it was all focused on depression and suicidality (which I don't have, i do have depression but not the other one). I got better because I was checked on every 15 minutes. then i left and slowly got worse and worse. It helped my depression because I was in a community for once, but as soon as I left none of them wanted to be friends depsite sharing like deep af shit. I can barely afford another hospital and anywher eI go will take my phone and I need to be able to talk to my girlfriend.

I've 20 therapists, most of them drop me and it's devastating, or are just so terrible I can't see them anymore. And all everyone fucking does it just try to do breathing exercises or tell you to accept it. I haven't heard a new piece of advice in a year. I've had like 7 psychiatrists and can't find one that has time for me or takes my insurance. And been on like 15 different meds at least. And I can't stick to taking meds because I have crazy side effects that make my hyponchodria worse. But I was on like 6 different meds at once at the hospital and those didn't even work for the anxiety. I tried a 10 course ketamine treatment that didn't do anything. I'm way too fucking scared of ECT and TMS and those are for depression anyway not anxiety.

I do NOT know what else to try. Mushrooms are legal in a place near me, so I am going to try to find someplace that sells me because I think the only thing that might help is some sort of spiritual enlightenment and acceptance of death. I can only be lucky I guess that I've only been like this for 2 years. I had some abusive relationships that I think made this kind of thing start. I wasn't like this before, I didn't even have anxiety. it's so fucking unfair. 

My left leg really fucking hurt yesterday and I'm afraid of a blood clot. It's better today so it doesn't make sense that it would be a clot? But I don't have any idea why it would have hurt like that and for so long, if it was DOMS it would have been the other leg.

Please help me. What else can I try?"
thank u,thank u everyone in this subreddit for all of ur good advice and empathy. it’s nice to read that other people go through the same things as i do <3
I hate my anxiety so much,"Urgh this is just to vent and get reassurance, I guess. So the other day I accidentally spilled water on my MacBook. Took it to the apple store and they said they could repair it and it was no problem and asked if I had a backup. I had just backed it up to an external hard drive a couple weeks ago (my iCloud is full) and hadn’t really done much in the meantime so I said it was fine if it got wiped during repairs. 

Of course, since then I’ve been panicking that I maybe didn’t back it up properly or something went wrong with the drive or my data will be corrupted or something. I’m beating myself up for not having them check before sending the laptop off for repairs. 

So now it’s 3:30 in the morning and I’m absolutely panicked that I’ve made a mistake that will lose all my schoolwork and pictures and everything. And I’m so angry at myself for not putting things onto OneDrive as well as the hard drive. Planning on going to the apple store first thing in the morning to have them check that I backed things up properly in case I can stop the repair before things are wiped if I messed up the back up. 
I don’t even know if they’ll be able to help me or if I’ll just make a fool of myself but I’m so so so panicked and I hate my brain for this (and for not backing things up better). 

Gah!"
Anxiety + covid - how did you cope? Asthma too,"I tested positive yesterday… I’m double vaxxed, constant mask wearer but I think I caught it at work as I work in education. 

Tonight has been the worst so far, the combo of waking up wheezing, dizzy, with a temp sent me into an anxiety attack, even harder to regulate my breathing. Ive finally started to calm down, my blue inhaler has helped my asthma and I have music on.

I’m not necessarily looking for solutions, maybe just a place for folk to share or vent. I must say I’m quite scared. I’m having flashbacks to the worst things I saw on tv earlier in the pandemic. I don’t want to end up in hospital. I finally stopped crying 15 minutes ago and I’ve barely cried at all since being on sertraline. 

Anyone got an experience or two to share? Anyone relate to where I am with it? Hope that’s ok to ask! Also apologies for formatting, I’m lying in bed on my phone."
Anyone else find it very hard to deal with nerves in the workplace?,
Managing PTSD,"I guess I’m at a loss. After everything I’ve been through I feel like I lost myself, a shell of who I was. Is there any way to manage this? I feel resentful for what happened Ed to me, I lost years of my life and feel like I’m so far behind where I should be in my life. I guess I’m posting here because I’m lying down here with crippling anxiety and I just do t know what the next step is to take."
Hydroxyzine 50mg- I’m scared,"Hi everyone. 

I was prescribed hydroxyzine(50mg) and Zoloft 25mg to help treat my anxiety. I have crippling health anxiety so I’m really scared to start this. I’m thinking of starting off with the hydroxyzine to help me sleep… but I’m seeing people say it made them dizzy…. As someone who struggles with off balance/dizziness(don’t know the exact cause,but doctors say it might be stress related) I’m kinda scared it’ll make it worse. 


Anyone who is or has taken hydroxyzine- has this made you dizzy? Any other side effects?"
Anyone else feel anxiety over every little thing?,"Anyone else have crippling anxiety over everything? I have always been kind of nervous about things and had some anxiety. It’s gotten to where every little thing feels me with fear though. Rather it be going out in traffic, going out to eat, having a conversation, or anything. 

I just signed on with a Real Estate company. You have to fill out an application and the Real Estate Commission does a background check on you. You also have to get fingerprints. I have never been in trouble with the law, (Knock on wood.) Yet, I am nervous about the background check. I just always have this fear that something bad is going to happen. Anyone else feel this way?"
Fatigue,"I’ve been experiencing fatigue for the past few weeks that’s been hard to shake off. It seems right around 3-4pm I start to get really tired and just want to nap the rest of the day. I’ve been pretty stressed out and anxious lately, so I’ve been hoping it’s just related to that.

Does anyone else get fatigue from stress and anxiety that lasts weeks?"
Ready to taper off Zoloft,Hello all I have been taking 100 mg Zoloft for 2 months and am ready to ween off. I was wondering the safest way possible to do it without these horrible withdrawal symptoms. And before you say anything about contacting my doctor I have tried and cannot get a straight answer. So if I had been taking the 100 mg for 2 months how should i ween off properly? I have read to decrease the dose by 50 mg and that’s all I can seem to find. Any help is appreciated 🙏
Discovered my dad is the root of my anxiety - cutting him out of my life - need advice or hear from someone who has gone through a similar situation,"I have struggled with panic anxiety disorder and ptsd for a while now. In 2013 I got a really bad panic anxiety attack and thought something was wrong with my heart. That year there were a lot of visits to the emergency room, hospitals and my doctor. They suspected something could be wrong with my heart, and had to have a 24h EKG a couple of times, and they did an ultrasound of my heart. Nothing turned up, and my heart was healthy. No one thought to suggest that it could be anxiety, so I went on with my life and it stopped for a while. Turns out I had a lot of minor anxiety attacks after this, and then it got really bad again in December last year. This was hands down my worst panic anxiety attack ever.

&#x200B;

Since then I went to a see a therapist. We found out that a lot of my anxiety attacks were because how my then stepmom treated me. She was verbally abusive all the time, and in some cases she was even physically abusive. This is were my PTSD stems from. I would for example get anxiety attacks if someone opened the door too fast (like she did, because that sound meant she was coming to scream at me). For a while I thought the root of my anxiety was her, cause I get really stressed if I think I'm doing something the wrong way etc. So I knew the PTSD and the fear of doing something the incorrect way was because of her, but I still felt something was missing. It didn't explain all of my anxiety.

&#x200B;

Recently I discovered that the root of my anxiety is my dad. That was when everything clicked in place. My mom said I have always been an anxious kid. The most annoying thing was that I always had to go to the bathroom no matter where we were and what we were doing (when my stresslevel is really high, I have to go to the bathroom really bad and often). 

My dad always put work before anything else. So from when I was around 4 years old, my dad would go to work before I usually woke up and come home late at night when I was asleep. If I wanted to see him, I had to wake up without an alarm clock or without my dad waking me up. I remember I always woke up in a panic and was really afraid that he was gone and would get out of my bed as fast as I could, run down the stairs and look out the window to see if his car was gone. If the car was gone, I would just cry hysterically for a really long time, and there was little my mom could do to calm me down. He was usually home on sundays but he didn't really spend much time with me.

When I was 6 up to 7 or 8 years old, before my parents slipt up, he would sometimes drive me to school and my siblings to kindergarden. I remember I just wanted to talk to him when he did this, but he was always on the phone the whole time and told us not to interrupt. I would often get so mad that I just walked away from him and walked to school myself. It took him a while to notice I was gone. If I didn't walk away, he would usually forget to drop me off at school (I was the last kid he would drop off), so he just drove right past it while on his phone. Then he would get mad at me for not reminding him that I was still in the car.

&#x200B;

When I was around 8 years old, my parents had split up and he was living by himself. We would spend time at his place every other weekend and every thursday. But those days were often cancelled because he had to work or just wanted to go out partying instead of spending time with us. When we were there, he was usually talking on his phone due to work, so we wouldn't really get to spend time with him. I would often get so mad that I ran away, and would often find a spot where I could see the road to see how long it would take before he noticed I was gone and went out looking for me. It usually took around an hour or two.  
Sometimes my dad would take us places, but it was usually because he was doing activities with his friends (often paintball), and we just had to sit and watch them play for a couple of hours, and then he was back on his phone.

&#x200B;

When I was 9, he got together with my then stepmom and quickly moved in with her and her two kids. Her kids always ruined our things, ran after us with swords or knives and just generally hurting us (her son for example broke my sister's arm and knocked out a tooth). Our then stepmom started to verbally abuse us pretty quickly and I told this to my dad several times. He refused to listen and just told me that I was exaggerating or that I just misunderstood the whole situation. I remember my mom eventually set up a meeting where my dad had to show up so that I could voice my concerns. He got really angry, said that he refused to listen to it and just stormed off. After this my dad told me I had to apologize to my then stepmom and needed to be nice to her. I had to live with them until I was 18 when I moved away. From I was 9 to 18 I tried several times to tell my dad how my then stepmom was but I was shut down as quickly as all the other times I did. In this time period I also tried to tell my grandmom (my father's mom) what was going on, but she too refused to listen. When I told my friends about the situation, or my boyfriends, they all said I was exaggerating and refused to believe me.  
In my teenage years I got pretty wild, and could pretty much do whatever I wanted without my dad questioning me why I was out all night or what I was doing. I could come home drunk and he wouldn't do much about it. I realize now that this was pretty much a cry for help and trying to get him to notice me.  
My then stepmom would also be verbally abusive right in front of him, and he would just ignore the situation and didn't do anything about it.  
I moved out when I was 18, but my then stepmom and my dad was my boss, so from 18 to 20 years old, I had to deal with her while I was on work (I needed the money).

&#x200B;

So I realize now where my insecurities come from and why I have anxiety and why I had the need to be noticed or acknowledged. Now I get a panick attack every time my stresslevel goes up and I can get a panick attack from pretty much anything, not just specific things.   
From 20 years old to now, 28 years old, he hasn't been good at reaching out, asking me how I'm doing and stuff like that. I rarely see him and I rarely speak with him. I realized all this for just a couple of days ago. I have now decided to cut him out of my life, based on something that happened this week. Last week he said he was coming to my town for a job meeting, and he made plans to go out to eat with me while he was in town. Two days before he was supposed to come to my town, I saw on snapchat that he and his family (his new girlfriend and their two kids) was traveling here. I didn't hear anything from him the first day they were in town, and I didn't hear anything from him the second day either. And then I saw on snapchat that they have gone home. I didn't hear a word from him. We had plan for the next day and I knew then that our plans would not happen (as usual. He often comes to my town for job meetings but never think to let me know, and the few times he does, he cancels on me). Then the day came, and I heard nothing. Today I got a message from him where he straight up lied to me, explaining that he hadn't traveled to my town and that the travel was cancelled because of the storm (the storm came in the afternoon the day we had plans, not the two whole days while he actually were in my town).

&#x200B;

I honestly feel really angry and disappointed at this moment. I've decided to cut him out of my life cause this is too toxic for me, and he doesn't respect me. I've also discovered that he has been talking trash about my fiancé, whom he has met briefly a few times. I've realized that after 28 years I'm just done trying to get my dad's attention and affection. I'm just done. And I realize that this means that I will probably lose contact with my grandmother, because she thinks my dad can do no wrong and refuses to listen if we tell her something she doesn't want to hear about him. This whole situation has driven my anxiety to go haywire.   
Sorry for the long post. I just had to get it out.  


Has anyone else been in a similar situation? I would love to hear it, or just general advice cause at the moment I feel like I'm being a huge asshole for doing this. Thanks."
Idk if it's anxiety but what do heart palpitations feel like? Just been vaccinated,I cant tell if I have palpitations from my first dose or if its just my anxiety
Should I go to my family doctor?,"I’ve been dealing with what Ive assumed to be anxiety my entire life (since I can remember, so like 6 or 7). Im no doctor but I know it has to be some sort of anxiety disorder. It’s affected everything I do for years and years on end and my lifestyle is entirely based around my fear. 

Anyways, I was wondering what steps I should take to finally get this treated? Would it be worth it to first go to my family doctor?"
Crippling fear of death,"Hopefully this is the right place to post this. 

I've recently been struggling with major fear of death. I use to have an issue with it as a kid, but it didn't last long. Now ever time I see my parents all I see is them dying on the way home or dying just going to get groceries. I see my mom being shot my someone at the event all because they are drunk and angry. I see my dad having another heart attack. I see my husband dying while on a 911 call (he's a paramedic) or someone plowing into their ambulance. These thoughts are so vivid it makes me physically sick. I'll cry for so long. I worry constantly. I don't know how to push through this. 

If it matters in 29F. I do have depression, GAD and BPD. We think I have undiagnosed ADHD as well. I've been seeing the same therapist for years and she actually recommended I try to find a community on Reddit to find others who have the same fear and what helps them. Back in 2019 I spent two months in an out patient treatment center because I attempted to take my life. I was not in a good place and I feel like I'm going back there. I don't want to."
Clonazepam vs Lorazepam,"Howdy.  I’m 42.  I asked my doctor to help me with anxiety.I was first given Clonazepam which I felt made me a bit sluggish. I would take a 0.5 pill once or twice a week. 

I asked if there is anything less sleepy and was given Lorazepam.  Couldn’t feel much of a difference but boy did I feel sad and depressed the next day. Just very sad and hopeless. 

I decided that Lorazepam is just horrible for me.  I like to enjoy a drink or two during the week and I make sure to not take any meds if I know I will have a few drinks.  

Anyone else experience these severe downs with Lorazepam ?"
How do I avoid being in a depressed mood while travelling in early October,"I often get in a low mood while trying to have fun or wanting to enjoy myself. Happens in the summer and at Christmas every year since those are my favorite times of the year. Here I am travelling in October to a wedding and am going to go out a week early and site-see in Colorado. I will be alone Saturday through Wednesday and won't have conversations to distract me. How do I stay in a good mood? It's also my 30th birthday that week which is why I am taking the trip though the birthday is not until Friday the 8th and I will be with people that day. 

 How do I avoid being sad?"
Fucking over everything,"I am fucking over everything... I am a college senior and the thought of graduating in May makes me cry. You see, I have a chaotic home life and the thought of having to move back into that chaos is so anxiety provoking. I have my dad who is emotionally volatile and any thing can set him off. Sucks to be around someone like that..never know when he is going to go off. I feel like there are so many expectations that come along with getting older and I still feel as though I am 19/20, even though I am 22. In some ways, I miss high school-I miss being young. I don't know...I just feel so mediocre compared to everyone else. Everyone around me has these crazy opportunities that come their way and I struggle even to reach out. Getting my current internship was such a challenge and I already fucked it up. There's a certain way that I want to execute myself and I'm pissed that I can't come across the way that I do in my mind. I can do so much more. Then, I hate being a friendless senior. It sucks. On one hand, it's my fault that I don't do more to stay in contact with people and consistently go to club meetings. Then its so stressful to hear people around me talk about post-grad life and they talk about in such a negative way. Yes, working is  fucking hard, but I feel like for me, I have to work... or else, I will just keep getting deeper in my anxiety. Plus, I don't even know what I want to do with my life...I feel so mediocre. Then on top of that, I have horrible body image issues and fucked up eating habits because I am very overweight and I'm short. So that fucking sucks. Then I feel like once you reach a certain age, people expect more from you. I am 22 and still live at home, only first had an internship and the remarks from people just make me feel like a fucking failure. I'm like 22 and people still think I'm in high school...how demoralizing when in just a couple of months I will be a college graduate. I used to see a fucking therapist but he was a complete asshole who made me feel like shit every time I left the appointment. I already carry so much shame and shit that he said didn't help. Each session he was like ""Oh you went to residential remember this..."". Bitch, that was fucking 3 years ago..I can barely remember what I did yesterday. Then this fucking asshole months ago implied that I wouldn't get my driver's license. I explained my situation to him over and over again and he still wasn't fucking grasping it. Well I passed anyways, so fuck him. His fucking remarks are the only reason why I passed because I wanted to prove this asshole wrong. Getting my driver's license was such a major accomplishment for me and his reaction was so subpar. I was so excited. Oh and then on top of that, I feel different from other people with anxiety disorders. Other people seem like they are still able to have friends, go to parties, network and do other shit. Well, I fucking struggle like there is no tomorrow with that. Now back to the asshole therapist, he fucking implied that I was a hermit and for weeks, he would badger me on dropping the sorority I was in. I fucking hated this sorority and was he the one paying for it? NOPE!!!!!!!!! pLUS it was so cliqueish and it ended up shutting down. 

&#x200B;

I want to find a new therapist but this process is so fucking annoying. I fucking hate going through the whole intake and shit. I thought about going back to my old therapist that I saw between the ages of 16-18.5, but ultimately decided against it because maybe I need a fresh start with a new therapist and I was a teen back then and I'm now an adult."
Scared of not being able to help,"So I've been going to a therapist for some time now, and made a lot of improvements over the months, but now I'm scared that I won't the able to help someone.

I'm obsessed with making everything to help other, and people around me are starting to say that I'm diving in to deep into others people's problems by trying to pull everyone else up, but for me it just doesn't feel right not to do everything I can to help someone.

This is getting to the point where I start another anxiety medication ( now 4 in total) to keep myself together and not get absolute demolished by everything around me.

I was to drunk and high when someone needed me, and from there on i can't forgive myself and I've been doing everything I can to try to help, i can't sleep if my phone isn't on max volume, i feel like I'm always walking on eggs when around others to not cause trouble.

Everyone tells me that ""you aren't going to change the world"" and that I'm going in way to deep most of the times, but all of that goes against my beliefs and I keep jumping into wells to try to pull other people other people out of them.

I made a small mistake a few days ago and I lost 1.5kg in one day because of the stress that it caused me 

I don't know what do to from here, i know I will keep placing other people wellbeing in front of mine and I'm scared shitless that i will breakdown again and then not be able to help anyone and burden other people in the process."
please reassure me changing jobs won’t ruin my life,"i got a job offer which is good! and the pay is better! and it lets me work from home unlike my current!

i am terrified of:
- bad work culture or more stressful workload! i would be the only woman in this tech startup team
- having less vacation days! its unlimited pto but will they pressure me??
- bad work life balance! they have an oncall rotation and im scared itll be bad ive never done oncall before

please if you have gone through these things just tell me it’ll be fine and worth risking or that it turned out okay for you or whatever thank you"
Is the white/ yellow cottage cheese sticky substance coming from my nose normal? (URGENT!!),Ok so I have a cold ( kinda nearing to end I think) and it was/is super bad with like chest heaviness and mucus in chest and coughs and sore throat and mucus in throat and bubble in nose and nasal drip and dizziness and a fever and runny nose and a stuffy nose etc etc all that stuff. and my right ear has been blocked for a couple days because of it I think (I can still hear but it’s lower) (maybe the other ear blocked too). With like a bit of whooshing sounds coming every now and then (like wind blowing. So today i was blowing my nose because my nose has been feeling STUFFYYY for days like I got the cold on Monday/late weekend and now it’s Friday and my nose has been feeling so full and every time I blow there’s like a bubble in there and I blow it back up and it goes in my throat and I swallow and I choke and so on. But 24/7 it feels like there’s a build up of snot and congestion and my throat sounds so nasally 24/7 it’s so hard to breathe from my nose so I was blowing and blowing and it’s so hard to get the snot out like when it did come out it was yellow and white and sticky and looked like cottage cheese and in my nose it had kinda a blue tinge but then I blew it out and it was either yellow or white and it was so sticky and thick. And i kept on blowing and blowing and more kept on coming it was so hard to get out idk if this is like build up  for days or something else I need to get checked out cos this carried on for like a full 10 or 20 minutes and u still feel bubbles in my nose EVERYTIME I breathe and stuff and it feels full. So is this all normal? Is this part of the cold? I also coughed up like yellow mucus too a couple times. I’ve also been rubbing my nose so much there’s like a red bump at the opening inside my nose lol. Will this all go away soon or a sign of something more serious like an ear infection or something else I need to get treated? Also every time I breathe I can feel the bubbles in my nose u know what I mean?
Taking buspirone in the day or at night?,I just got prescribed this and am uncertain about when to take it. Ive heard mixed things about taking it at both times
Sudden chest pain causing me to panic,Ok so have the anxiety where I worry about my overall health and I was just laying down and my chest had this very painful and sharp pain in It and I haven’t worried in a week and now I’m getting scared.

I'm uncomfortable in my apartment,"Ever since I moved into my apartment, I have felt uncomfortable. The energy just does not seem right, and I have troubles sleeping. I have tried to decorate my place. I also have many house plants.

Other info: I work from home, and my window faces east but does not get direct sunlight 9 months out of the year.

My apartment is a studio where each ""room"" has an arched open doorway wall separating the three ""rooms"". The arched doorway is as large as 60in wide.

If you walk in thru my front door from the hallway, you are in my office with the kitchen on your left and bedroom on your right. 
Standard kitchen, really, with a furnace in it. my office and dining room (desk, eating table, book case) are the same function. My bedroom also serves as my living room (tv, couch, and closet on one side, bed on the other. 

I struggle to feel at peace, I struggle falling asleep/staying asleep/waking up.

When I sleep in my childhood bedroom at my parents, most of these issues subside.

Any advice is very much appreciated. I cannot afford to move due to where I live, but I can afford to redecorate."
Will everything be okay?,Will everything be okay? I feel so lost with my life. I feel like a failure. I feel like I’m running out of time
Better Help,Has anybody here actually tried using it!??
Does anyone ever get anxious when they see a friend post online,Hi I’m new to this subreddit and am currently dealing with anxiety from the loss of my father in December of 2020. After my father passed away in December of 2020 I had been doing well I never felt anxious about anything really but after I got a new job in August where I’ve been more isolated I’ve had multiple breakdowns where I relive the night when my father died. I brought it up with a female friend and my girlfriend. After that it felt good to finally let people know what I was going through and it was the first step for me to get help. But now whenever I see my female friend post anything online I get extremely anxious and feel trapped. My mind has associated seeing her with my anxiety and it seems to be getting worse. I am going to bring this up with my counselor next week and see what he thinks i should do but I think cutting contact for with her for awhile might be the best solution. Please let me know if anyone else has had this and what they did to help it.
My grades PLUMMETED this year and i've never been this stressed out in my life,"Edit: OK GUYS IM GOING TO STOP COMPLAINING AND IM GOING TO GET ALL THE WEEK'S WORK DONE NOW AND IM GOING To STUDY FOR MY EXAMS WOOOO UH im going to post on this sub again next week and be like, i got my grades up. 

I've ALWAYS been an A student, my entire life. Now im a senior in HS. So I started taking classes at community college in the mornings, I take three classes there per semester, psychology, public speaking, and personal finance. God they are so hard I have B's in two of them and a C in one and its stressing me out so much when my parents find out theyre going to go insane and im so worried

I also work as a freelancer so i have to write around 10k words in research writing/marketing a week, and i ALSO have highschool full time, and ALSO i got hired at the grocery store and im going to be working 16 hours a week starting next week and I love that im doing all this cause i need money but it is absolutely at the expense of my grades and im caring more about making money than good grades now. Honestly, i dont care about school at all anymore. Which is a feeling ive never felt because ive always been so worried about it. Now i cant bring myself to try cause it seems useless anyways. grades are dumb, but then seeing that i have bad grades is worrying me so much and idk what to do

I think im going to use it as a motivator to try realy hard on my next few assignments and bump up my grades for all those classes, but still, im really stressed out about it and i had to rant lol"
Propranolol and Drinking - Advice please,"Hi guys,

A few months ago, I got prescribed 10mg propranolol on as take as I need basis. So I'm still pretty new to this.

Just looking for some advice in regards to drinking. I am going clubbing soon and am a little nervous about the amount of people so thinking about taking some prop first. I am going to be drinking so wondering about people experiences. I have quite a high tolerance (whole bottle of (cheap) wine without getting tipsy).

People who have drank on propranolol, how much does it affect you? Does it make it stronger? Make you more nauseous? More hungover? 

Basically should I try it or just get very drunk to beat the anxiety haha

Please help xx"
Lexapro,"Hello, I am 22 y/o and just started lexapro. I’m on day 6 of 5mg and will be increasing dose up to 10mg on day 8. I have had 0 appetite at all and my anxiety has still been absolutely horrible. I cry all the time still and have daily panic attacks and ruminating anxious thoughts. I guess I’m just looking for reassurance that it will get better and it will work. I’m terrified I’m going to be stuck in this horrible feeling forever and am going to let life pass by me. I have Ativan 0.5mg to take as needed as well but that just seems to make me calm but Doesn’t stop my worrying. Looking for support :("
Does anyone else get bursts of energy where they can power through a bunch of “scary” things at once?,"My anxiety has gotten better over the years, but I still let “scary” things pile up and then get more anxious about them the more I let them build (y’all know how it is!) But, once in a while, I will get a burst of confidence and knock five things off my scary list at once. For example, the other day I set up a doctors appointment, resolved something with my pharmacy, submitted a maintenance ticket, got an estimate for a car repair, opened an email I had been avoiding, and dug into an intimidating project at work. That’s more than I can typically handle in a month. Does anyone else get this? Is there a way to harness the power?"
Where can I go? What can I do?,"I have had almost constant anxiety for the past three months. I dread the weekdays because I am completely unfocused at work. I dread the weekends because I have so many unplanned hours to just sit and worry.

Three months ago I was totally normal and confident. It feels like the bottom has completely dropped out of my life and that I am going nuts.

I’m on week three of Lexapro but all it seems to have done so far is make me not cry.

Is there anywhere I can go? I have been trying to see a psychiatrist but I can’t seem to get into see one. Even if I do I know that it will take a while for whatever they do to work.

I talk to my wife about my issues but I know it is getting wearing on her.

Is there any kind of a recovery center or anything I can go to?"
Klonopin .25 mg ODT is a hit or miss.,"Yeah it's a low dose, 1x per day as needed with 15 allotted to me each month. With my history, I should be thankful I have any. I've had 4-5 occasions where it actually worked and I could feel something, but every other time I felt nothing. On a particularly bad night I did something I shouldn't have and took 4 at once (1mg). Absolutely nothing. Anyone else experience this? I want to try another low dose of a different benzo but I'm nervous to ask because of my history. Those of you who have experienced this, did other benzos work better? Which ones did you have success with? Or perhaps even something else like gabapentin, or god forbid, Lyrica (in my dreams). From what I understand gabapentin is well tolerated and while still being abusable isn't really comparable to benzos for most people

EDIT: for more information my general anxiety hasn't been a huge issue since I've started paxil but it hasn't affected my panic attacks at all which is what eventually led me to being put on Klonopin in the first place after some hospitalizations and long periods of insomnia"
i feel completely discouraged from job searching,"just thinking about my job interview last week, i feel super discouraged...i'm not out going, cheerful, or out spoken and engaging....i feel like i'll never be able to find a job...because even if i do apply and get an interview, my anxiety will take over and i'll preform horribly during the interview...i just checked on the job website i use, and i saw i got ""not selected"" on the job i interviewed at...

i know i shouldn't be this depressed or discouraged about it (people get rejected for these things all the time), but to me, this meant a lot to me. this was my first time doing this job stuff outside of school, and it just feels so discouraging that i'm not good at talking, and im assuming that's what made them not like me at the interview...

i can't get past it. i'm supposed to job hunt again after finding out if i got selected or not, and since i just saw i wasn't selected, i know i should look again, but i cant....i feel so sad about it."
Vaccine and nerves,"I am getting my first vaccine today, and I am beyond scared. My OCD is going absolutely mad. I am nervous for an allergic reaction even though I’ve gone over the ingredients a million times. I’ve googled them, researched them, found products like food and stuff I use every day with them it in, and yet I am still nervous. The anxiety is making me have a bad headache and feeling sick to my stomach. I’ve already cancelled once and I don’t want to cancel again. I need this shot. Any tips?"
I have to date women,"So I’m doing pretty well these days. 

I kicked depressions ass, and anxiety isn’t destroying me like it used to. 

I’ve gone through exposure therapy and it’s done wonders. 

One last step though. 

My therapist told me to get on a dating app and meet up with women. (Because they’re kind of the ultimate thing that stresses me.) 

I get along fine with girls and I know some find me attractive, it’s just, until now shyness made dating impossible. Add My fear of intimacy in the mix of and here I am a 23 year old virgin.

But let’s forget about sex, for now. I should focus on dating and having a good time. The rest will come. 

But this is terrifying. So I guess I’m asking you for tips ? 

I’m not asking for dating advice, but how to I find the courage to do this ? 

Peace !"
Anxiety about getting new obsessions,Does anyone else here have ocd and is scared of getting new obsessions. Like a lot of thoughts that come into my head even sometimes positive I get scared I’ll get obsessed. I’m also scared the things I do are compulsions and rituals when they are literally just normal things I do I hate it
Anxiety,"Does anyone get to the point where they’re too anxious and they start hearing voices or seeing things?, a few year back I started hearing voices and seeing things that weren’t there and the people I was under put it down to my anxiety. 

I’ve been anxious after that and my voices start again but not as bad as it did a few year back."
anxiety gods rly fucking with me 😐,"i'm on debate team, only because i brought it up ONCE and my mom got so happy i felt like i had to join. tomorrow we have our first tournament, this is my first one ever since i just joined this year. i have to give at least 2 3-minute speeches and ask at least 4 questions. and THEN. i have HOMECOMING 😭 i really don't want to go to the tournament but i'd feel bad bailing so last minute. what do i do"
coping suggestions?,"i’ve been struggling with GAD for awhile now and have a therapist but she recently told me i had to think of with some coping mechanisms myself that resonate with me for when i get really anxious. we’ve come up with some in therapy like yoga, meditating, and journaling, but i’m not the best at sticking with them. i’m able to do basic ground techniques and stuff but i’m looking for suggestions for more long term coping mechanisms to help when my anxiety gets really bad i guess? 
any suggestions would be greatly appreciated."
Lexapro gave me severe sexual dysfunction,"the lowest dose of lexapro, 5mg, gave me quite bad ED and genital numbness, when I stopped, it persisted for a week. Along with some pelvic/testicle pain. 

So do I have to either choose my mental health over my sexuality?"
Therapist of only ONE session has caused me a lot of anxiety and suicidal thoughts. Messages below.,"Context: I became very sick yesterday with a cough/cold. I slept most the day and the other half I spent worrying about work and money if I had 10 days off with COVID isolation (I'm on 0hr). I forgot to text him about my symtoms for my 2nd session today. I know that's my fault! I realised at 8am and had a mini panic and texted him. With me being sick/half daze/panic, and because I'm also used to NHS services, it just didn't click with me he'd have to take me off the wait list as he can only have a certain number of patients. 

I'm so embarrassed and guilty that not only did I forget to text him, but I feel that he thinks I have only apologised to get my own way (back on his wait list). To be fair, I don't actually remember signing a contract, and he didn't tell me about his policies in the first session. 

I would have been fine to pay the fee for this session if he asked me, or even if he explained to me that I needed to be taken off his list for now as it was late notice. But he didn't really explain what his policies are, he just kind of did it leaving me confused.

My anxiety is sky high, I feel an enormous amount of guilt and I don't want to be on this shitty planet any more. I also feel annoyed that he went from 0 to 100 and wasn't softer about his approach. 

Oh he also called me poor in the first session... ""oh you're a support worker, you're poor"" which was meant as a joke but I was still a bit like 😬. He offered me £5 off £95 in which I was equally appreciative and insulated.

Now I just hate myself for not looking at the red flags, for letting him know about not being able to attend too late, not understanding the fact I have been taking off his client list, and the way I've allowed this to affect me so much. 




ME: Hi. Unfortunately I have covid symptoms so won't be able to make it in today. Can we rearrange once my PCR test is back please?


HIM: Hi, I’ll offer today’s appointment to those waiting. Please get in touch when you don’t have symptoms.


ME: Hiya, PCR came back negative. I still have symptoms of a cold but feeling ok. It's up to you whether i should come in. I'm available Wednesday 29th or Thursday 30th next week or Monday 4th or Thursday 7th the week after. If not, I will message you when my symptoms have completely gone 🙂

HIM: Hi, I’ll contact you when I have availability as I’ve had to offer your space to someone on the waiting list.

ME: Ah ok, no problem!

ME: I'm sorry I'm a bit confused after rereading, has my entire spot on your list been replaced? Sorry I don't mean to be rude I'm just confused!

HIM: Hi, sadly - I can’t keep future appointments open when someone is unable to say when they can/ can’t see me. As was our case. 

So someone had the session you and I had booked. 

At 2.20 they asked for a sesssion next Friday. As I didn’t have anything back from you I said yes. I wasn’t expecting you to notice Covid symptoms and get a PCR test all within a 6 hour timeframe to be honest. 

So they were able to start therapy at 2.20pm today. You weren’t - to the best of my knowledge, at 2.20pm able to start.  So yes, this person has taken the available session space. I hope this clarifies.

ME: I'm so sorry it was such short notice - I was so poorly yesterday  afternoon I just slept.

I'm just a little confused as to why I can't book another session?  If someone replaces one of my sessions (which was obviously fair enough), do they replace my spot on your client list? Sorry I hate to ask

HIM: Hi, who is the greatest of respect. If you knew you couldn’t attend a session yesterday because you’re so poorly and had Covid symptoms, it would’ve been very helpful for me to have known that yesterday.

ME: No I know I am really sorry. I got ill quite quick and was asleep from 4pm - midnight. It just slipped my mind at midnight too with me still feeling very under the weather.

HIM: Hi, I run a small business I  that employs three people. It is important that I maximise the sessions that are available. Despite the late notice, I offered your appointment to somebody else today and they were able to make it. At 2:20 pm I had two patients who I had assessed - yourself and this patient who were both wanting therapy. This patient was able to start. You were not, at that moment. So the appointment slot has gone to this patient.

ME: I understand that. I'm not expecting for you to prioritise my appointment over anothers, I appreciate it was late notice. When I have had counselling before, a sickness meant the appointment was rearranged. I am unsure of how you work especially in the private sector but wanted to clarity if it was the same. I may have misinterpreted and thought I was taken off your list completely. I'm not trying to be rude I just wanted clarification, sorry"
i think i know a reason behind some of my issues,"okay so first i’ll start with like a few tws

Medical
Doctors 
Mention of Consent being done for me



i’m gonna try and keep this as vague as possible

so like when i was younger i had a lot of stomach issues TMI stuff, and i had something done that my mum consented too for me (i think i was too young tok consent myself) but ever since then i run from doctors if they try to touch me, specifically near my stomach/below area, becahse i was terrified it was gonna happen again, and i have no idea how to tell anyone how much it traumatised me?

because it was consensual i have no reason to feel this uncomfortable/grossed out about it but no one knows why i have so much fear around people/doctors

i think it was also because it was a male doctor and i’m AFAB, (assigned female at birth) and it was very medical and stuff but it literally traumatised me"
Anybody else feel like they’re constantly getting sick with something?,"I swear it always feels like I’m coming down with a fever, or a cold. My anxiety makes it worse believing I have Covid or something and it’s a nightmare having this crap! I have weakness, an abundance of nausea, hot/cold flashes, dizziness, general malaise. Anyone else get this or like this?"
anxious in class because of a certain person,"hey y’all. For clarification, and TLDR purposes, a girl sits behind me who I fear, neither of us can move & I need tips on how to stay calm.  

The girl who I have had beef with since pre-k (I’m a senior now) sits directly behind me. We haven’t seen each other in four years because I moved away for awhile, but she has grown into your typical hick/republican mean girl. We are polar opposites. She bullied me in middle school and has been nothing but nice to me so far but it’s only a matter of time before we clash in the classroom or she starts bullying again. I just want to know how to stay calm and tips to quietly manage intense anxiety around her. I am afraid."
Getting on Anti-Anxiety Meds,"After I'd say a nearly 7 year battle with anxiety (and a multitude of other mental disorders) I am getting assessed next week for anti-anxiety and probably other medications. I have heard everything BUT good things about mental health medications and that is why I have avoided this option for so long.  I am extremely nervous about starting them as I don't know what to expect. I am especially very nervous about a strong anti-anxiety med such as xanax.I discussed with my therapist about getting on anti-anxiety meds. They said it's whatever I am comfortable with and gave me my recommendation. I have no idea what medications are good medications. I don't know where to start as far as research. My assessment is on the 27th and my psychotherapy appointment is on the 29th, and as the date slowly approaches I am getting progressively more nervous. Even if I know it's just my anxiety. Any advice would help."
I can't stop overthinking everything," I can't stop overthinking and analysing things I've done in the past, I can't stop worrying what other people think or tell about me. How to deal with it?"
Tips on slowing down eating,"I wake up, suck down breakfast because I have to run for the bus. At work, I pretty much have to suck down my food between phone calls. No real break for lunch, so it's get it in while I can. I tried not eating at work, but yeah that doesn't work well when working 12-16 hours. When I get home, well it's bedtime, no time for food.

Fine. The problem is, that carries over to when I'm off. I just always feel rushed eating, because I normally have no time to do so. I'm not severely overweight, and I don't feel hungry when I'm done because I ate too fast, but I find I just don't enjoy it (which IMO sucks more than being hungry after). I prepare my food, put extra care into it being it's my day off, just to find at the end of the meal... all that work I did and I don't even remember tasting it. Tonight for example, a nicely seasoned steak, and chomp chomp gone. Honestly more than half of my meal I can say I don't remember what it tastes like.

I can maybe slow down for one or two bites, say ""hey, this tastes great, now keep it up..."" and before I know it, done. ""Hey... how did that taste? Ummm... dunno, really.""

I've tried putting down the utensils, water, smaller bites, none of that stuff seems to work for more than a few bites. Each time I sit down, I try, and the result is the same.

In the end, it kind of causes a little additional anxiety because I realized I didn't take the time to enjoy when I should have.

I've searched the web, I've tried various things I read, nothing seems to work. So, I come to you all for suggestions. What works for you, that isn't common knowledge?"
Anyone else in the UK suffering from added anxiety about the ongoing issues projected by the media?,"With the headlines being filled about food shortages, petrol shortages, increasing gas and tax that are being blasted over the news and social media, like others I’m sure, it’s really affecting me and starting to struggle with coping. I’ve now deleted most of my social media except Reddit as I haven’t seen it as much here and Pinterest. Im trying to also avoid the news as much as I can. Does anyone have any tips on how to cope when everything feels never ending?"
How to professionally talk about my mental health for college?,Hello! So I didn’t know where to ask this so please lmk if there’s a better forum for this. I am in college but I noticed I took way too much class for me to handle and I am not feeling too good as of now. I’ve been going through anxiety and I am better enough to go to school. But I overestimated my capabilities. So I want to drop a class and it requires me to put a reason and get an approval from my professor. So how should I word it so I don’t sound too unprofessional but also get them to understand that I am not dropping it because I want to?
I think I’m to the point where I cannot physically shed tears or fully cry,"I’m exhausted and burnt out. I’m to the point of tears but I can’t cry any tears. I don’t know what to do make myself cry. I also don’t want anyone to walk in on me if I actually do cry. This might me extreme, but I want to hurt myself, so the pain might make me cry, and then go from there. I hate that I may have to cause physical pain in order to cry. My anxiety has been so bad this week. The only non-pain related thing that would make me cry? A cuddle or just being held. I want to be held so bad. I wish I could make that happen for myself."
I don’t know anymore,Wish I could just walk straight. Say yes or no. Make a decision and stick to it. I feel so cold. I don’t talk to people. I just go to work and drone on like I’m not even there. There’s so much going on in my head and I just don’t understand right now. I resent everyone yet I long for connection. Wondering when the good news comes that this life is all just a joke or something because it doesn’t feel real anymore
Ketamine,Has anybody here tried IV Ketamine infusion therapy? I’m starting in a few weeks and I’m a bit nervous.
I’m going on a date in a few hours,I’m so nervous I’m gonna do something wrong how tf am I gonna do this .
I got back bad health news and I'm in an anxiety attack please help,"I already took my anxiety med I'm waiting for it to kick in.

I feel like crying. 

It isn't an ""end of the world"" diagnosis but after recently suffering a saddle pulmonary embolism I just cannot take another health problem right now. I'm only in my 20s I shouldn't be dealing with this.

Please any support or hugs would really help"
