pwetst,Tightness in my neck and palpitations,I have been having spasms in my eye constantly and tremors in my hand for quite some time. Did some research and came to the conclusion that It can happen due to normal stress. But I'm worried. I feel a lot of tightness in my neck usually. Dealing with heart palpitations as well(though it's not severe imo). Anybody else who might have faced the same. How did you work around this?,2021-09-27 16:42:18
pwep2s,Anxiety attack and suicidal thoughts.,"I had gynecomastia surgery about a month and half ago. And they say it takes 3 months to see final results. But I overlook myself in the mirror and it doesn’t look appealing, I constantly think of the worst outcomes and that I might need to get another surgery in future and it’s been eating up my mind because if that happens my post graduation study plans are going to be affected and also I don’t want to get into a cycle of surgeries. I am so scared and having suicidal thoughts.",2021-09-27 16:33:24
pvs90i,Beer reduces my anxiety.,"Hi Please help me I ask for your advice.

I would like to know how it is possible that beer makes me feel very good. I am diagnosed with ADHD.

My ADHD has never been a problem but since. for the last 4 years I have been experiencing increased fatigue and anxiety and a problem with sleep. I noticed that my anxiety and fatigue disappear after drinking beer. I thought it was only a short-term relief caused by alcohol, but I began to notice that anxiety did not disappear when start drinking beer or getting drunk, but only when I sobering up.

I thought it was caused by alcohol, but when I drank other alcoholic beverages, the anxiety is still the same.

I experimented and found that after drinking 3.4 glasses of beer I feel fresh and without anxiety (When I drink a lot of beer the next day I feel without anxiety but with a hangover and sadness - I think bcs worse quality of sleep). Falling asleep has improved and the next day I am cheerful and without anxiety. Unfortunately, it doesn't last forever. 2-3 days after (drunk beer) I start to feel anxiety and sadness.

I experimented with GABA receptors - (I got some benzo for the test, which helped me (about 2-3 days) with short-term anxiety, but due to addiction, tolerance and unhealthy I quit them) I did not feel as resh and cheerfu after benzo as after beer.

I found out that beer contains Uridine (Yes, I know it can be harmful) Uridine helped me fall asleep, but the next day I'm still tired and anxious.

I think beer contains some types of probiotics / prebiotics that can improve my anxiety. What do you think about it ?

I have already tried a lot of stimulants (Caffeine, Meth, Moda) They only helped for a short time. 1-2 weeks of use, the feeling of fatigue, anxiety and sadness returned. Poor falling asleep, emotional flatness and no-motination.

What in beer can so well affect my anxiety motivation and joy?

I know that occasional drinking doesn't hurt, but I don't want to drink every 2nd day to feel better. Alcohol does not bring me any greater joy. I like to get drunk with friends 1 month, but I don't want to drink 1 in 2 days so often

PS: Sorry for my English",2021-09-26 17:13:43
pw4t77,my roommate and her friends have been telling me to get more confidence,"So i just got a roommate who’s very outgoing and pretty straight forward about stuff. we often hang out, smoke, drink, etc together. She’s been always telling me to stop saying sorry so much and that i need more confidence. Apparently her friends agree as well, that saying sorry so much makes me too nice and that ppl will walk all over me. I already knew this but it’s so hard to not say sorry for everything, i just feel like i’m the issue for everything. like we were at a club last night and i just got so anxious i had to leave and i feel bad bc they helped me a lot but if i wasn’t socially anxious i wouldn’t be having these issues. 

like i want to have self confidence, i want to stop thinking i’m ugly and annoying but it’s so hard. ppl don’t realize that having toxic parents/childhoods really fuck you up",2021-09-27 04:54:18
pwa59i,Fear of being drugged or poisoned???,I just wanted to know if anybody else has an irrational fear of being drugged or poisoned. its so weird idk why its gotten this bad. say you go to a gas station and the bags of chips are lined up ill get the one in the middle thinking if somebody tampered with it it wouldnt be that one and that goes for anything. i recently had an anxiety attack because i touched the keypad to put in the pin for my debit card and i convinced myself it had lsd on it. it sounds ridiculous. i wont drink water bottles if i have left them out of my sight for too long. ill buy fast food and look at it and if i see something i dont liked i.e black speck i wont eat any of it i turn the water bottle cap when i buy them to make sure the seal hasnt been broken. i wont touch doorknobs or other house hold objects for the fear of drug residue on it ( my mother has recently gotten back on meth thats why but ive been like this beforehand ) i wont eat food in the fridge at my own home because i think its either drugged or poisoned. it didnt use to be this bad it just recently got this way. i dont know if this anxiety related but i get anxious about it. could anybody shed some light? what kind of help should i seek out to get rid of this. please anything.,2021-09-27 10:29:08

pwebjj,I feel alone,"I’ve been battling anxiety for many years but it has gotten more intense recently due to some events. A few days ago, I was having a panic attack and reached out to my SO via call. We’ve been together for some time but I’ve always been “closed off” in some ways. The day before, he was very supportive of my concerns which made me feel I could trust him and lean on him more.

During the call, he was trying to be supportive but was unintentionally doing the opposite by continuously talking about the trigger. I tried to keep calm but eventually lost my cool and snapped at him saying “Omg. Can you please stop?”. He was hurt and said he was going to end the call. He texted me saying he just wants progress and that I don’t make it easy. He said he was sad by how I acted and hasn’t been talking to me since. I've texted him saying I know he was just trying to help and my reaction was inappropriate and explained what I felt. We still haven't been talking much.

Earlier on, I had to call a helpline on behalf of my mother as she’s not very good with English. I've been putting it off as calling helplines makes me very anxious but I had to do it as she needed it done urgently. I called and everything was going okay until I needed to call Company B and then Company C to settle it. I started to feel unsettled as it was becoming more complicated than I thought. Then during the call, my mother's ringtone went off full blast next to me which I scrambled to turn it off. My thoughts started to race and when the call ended my mother was talking to me of which I snapped at her. I felt like an a-hole and broke down in my room.

I feel alone in this. I feel like my SO doesn't understand my struggles simply because he doesn't go through them. I feel like I’m a broken thing that is unworthy of love. I know that’s not true and everyone deserves good things in their life but I can’t help but feel like I’m a defective object.",2021-09-27 16:05:59
pwe7f1,Anxiety help,"I'm new to this anxiety world and honestly it's been a roller coaster ride so far. I have a boyfriend who loves me and I've been with him for 3 years now and it's just been great. And I come from a toxic home, my dad passed away 6 years ago and I live with my mother and sister. So my anxiety actually started when my boyfriend came back from his home town and I stayed with him for 10 days and when it was time to come back home... 3 anxiety attacks in a day. Since then I have managed it quite well and have been talking to a therapist as well. 
What's bugging me now is that whenever I stay at my boyfriend's place it's chill but when I come back home I have nothing really to distract me so much and the toxic environment just drives me to work more but lately I've been feeling like not working even at home and I feel if I live with my boyfriend I'll chill there too. Am I just avoiding reality? Please help.",2021-09-27 15:57:30
pwe3gk,Does anyone else experience severe panic every time they start to fall asleep?,"*my doctor has told me I do not have sleep apnea*
This has been happening to me for about a year and a half every single night, several times a night and I can not find ANY WAY to fix it and I need advice. I just want to sleep. Sometimes it just feels like a rush of extreme panic and fear and I shoot out of bed gasping for air, other times it feels like my throat is collapsing and I wake up choking, gasping for air and panicking. sometimes it feels like my heart stops and I wake up with a gasp. Most of the time it’s the throat collapse feeling accompanied by really bad panic. Does this happen to anyone else?? Any advice at all? I haven’t fallen asleep peacefully in over a year and I would do ANYTHING for one night of peaceful sleep… I know people that experience this every once in a while but I have never come across ANYONE that experiences it every single night multiple times before they can fall asleep. I can’t even find anything on the internet about this shit. I feel so alone about it….",2021-09-27 15:49:22
pwdz6o,Something I notice,"This may or may not be anxiety related but there was something I noticed about people yesterday and it’s causing me not to sleep. So yesterday, I went out shopping like I normal do every month with my mom and I noticed a few people who were doing strange things. 

It started out with people just standing in the way or for instance if you’re trying to walk down the aisle at the grocery store, some random person will just walk up and stop in your way. This happened to me at least a dozen of time until I became frustrated and gather what I needed and left. But I did notice that there was a lot of people just stopping and staring at nothing. 

When I got to the check out line, there was a man who just stood there as if he was day dreaming and would not move. I don’t know if I was “lagging” or if the guy wasn’t paying attention but he just stood there and the cashier didn’t say anything. After two minutes I guess he woke up and moved up to check out. I was next and I place my items and I saw this lady behind me doing the same thing. She was a good 20 feet behind me and she just stood there didn’t move. I assume it was because of “covid” and she was keeping distance but my things were already bagged and there was room on the conveyor belt for her to set her items down. She did not move and she also stood there for 5 minutes just staring at nothing. 

I shook it off and headed out the door with my mom and child, but he wanted a sandwich so I got him food. We loaded up the car and then we headed out of the parking lot. As we pull up to the light, I notice the same woman who was behind me standing at the cross walk on the other side of the street, but she was just standing there on the curb. It wasn’t a bus stop, no sign she was reading; just an vacant lot with tall grass and debris.  She stood there at the middle of the cross walk not movie at all. No cars blew at her or stopped she just stood there. (She was already on the other side of the street but she was just standing at the curb). Before anyone assume, I did think she was waiting for a ride. The only thing that made me realize she wasn’t was the simple fact her back was turned away from the streets and she just stood there as if she was walking frozen in time. She was standing as if she was about to complete her walk but she was paused. We headed to a different store to shop for food and I noticed the same thing happening again this time at the produce section of the store. It was people just standing there. This started to remind me of a movie. No one was moving for a while and then it was like someone hit the play button. I got my things and got the hell out. I get home and as I was putting up the food, I turned to my mom to ask her a question and she was just standing there like she was in a trance like state. And I asked if she’s ok. She goes “yea what’s wrong with you”. And I’m like but you were just standing there staring at the floor. She goes “No I wasn’t “ and I just side eye her.

Am I tripping or is there something more going on that I don’t know about. I don’t want to sound like I’m paranoid. But yesterday was very strange to me. Has this happen with anyone else?",2021-09-27 15:39:59
pwdwno,Nausea/Anxiety when leaving house,"It's been around 3 or 4 years since I cannot leave my house due to anxiety anymore. I always kinda disliked being outside for too long (loved it when little tho), but it suddenly got worse one day. Couldn't go to school anymore because each day in the morning I'd get extrem nauseous and have a lowkey panic attack. Also didn't help that I barely slept and was struggling with insomnia (still am and my sleep schedule is horrible. I've been told fixing it would ease my morning sickness but it's hard to ne consistent).

I went to therapy, got medication and things got better for a while, but I stopped that after I graduated because that was literally the only reason I wanted to go to therapy - to be able to graduate. Also some appointments got forgotten so I didn't bother making new ones anymore and got off medication as well. I was doing okay. Antidepressants made me a functioning human being, yet I don't want to have to keep being dependent on them. Also side effects. Not fun. (Should I tho if they were helping me so much?) 

Now after covid happening and staying home almost constantly for like 2 years, also online university, have made it a little bit too comfortable for me again. I noticed whenever I leave the house I literally want to throw up. I just feel so nauseous, my stomach cramps and I feel dizzy. It's even far worse than 3 years ago. I tried taking my prescribed xans from back then but I dislike xanax and I'd rather not take them (making me even more tired than already, weird feeling even at lowest dose, hangovers).

So I'm here to ask if anyone has similar experiences, fears going outside ans what I can do about it. Also any ideas why that is even happening in the first place? Maybe anxious about leaving my safe space? Idk what to do. Soon university isn't online anymore and I'm scared I won't be able to attend due to this painful anxiety. I just wanna be a functioning human being. 

Thanks in advance

And then you get to lesson and you find out either the teacher has set back the due date for the class giving you enough time to complete it (and you ask yourself what the hell was all that worrying about) or the teacher is not in and you have a substitute teacher and they dont ask about the homework or assignment that's due that day maybe because they didn't know or forgot and again you are relieved to have more time to complete the homework or assignment and wonder what all that stress and worry was about.",2021-09-27 15:34:44

pwd99e,27(M) - Anxiety throat (trigger) (please consider this),"Anxiety in Swallowing:
Morning fellow redditors. I thought a lot about writing or not a post in here, but here I am. It’s been 16 days now from when it all started. I was out for the weekend with my Gf and we were enjoying our time, until when I started feeling something weird in my throat, almost like it was swollen. We were having a glass of wine and I was smoking a cigarette. Since I suffer from acid reflux I reckoned it was better off to quit with the cigs for the day, then we headed to dinner. There, I started realizing how swallowing food felt weird and I couldn’t do it no more. I stopped eating and became a little paranoid over it. Roughly 40 minutes after it, as we were walking in the city. I had an anxiety attack, and I couldn’t hold myself. My girl was there for me and tried to keep me calm, nonetheless I didn’t feel like walking or catching a metro to come home, since my Heart felt like coming out my chest. We got a taxi and headed back to the hotel, where I was able to calm down (struggling a bit) and fall asleep. The day after we sort of enjoyed our day but I didn’t feel like eating anything solid. I went asap to see a throat doctor , which told me my tonsils were a bit swollen because I got some little pieces of food stuck in it (due to the structure of the same). I started treating both my throat and my acid reflux now, but still I’m having troubles to eat, especially when I’m outside in crowded cities, where anxiety attacks me out of nowhere. My biggest fear now is to talk or stress too much about it, and influence my beloved ones, which does nothing but giving me lots of more anxiety. I’m seeing a Therapist on Wednesday and I’m taking just some plant-based medications at the moment, open to suggestions though..",2021-09-27 14:38:47
pwd55k,Vent,"I hate it when people tone down anxiety. When I was going back to school nobody really understood that I felt like my lungs and heart were being ripped out and eaten in front of me every second. All they think is I'm being like ""oh little bit nervous teehee 👉👈 I wonder who's gonna talk to me.""

No

Just no

""Are you anxious about school? Awwwe don't worry we all are"" are you puking due to the intense anxiety you feel every morning just by the thought of school? Are you ripping at your skin in class without even knowing because you can't handle not knowing what everyone is thinking or doing? Do you break down when you have to talk to the teachers about going to the bathroom and when you do get permission to go to the bathroom you end up not going out of fear that the teacher was probably joking with you? So far people who say ""aww we all get anxious about school"" don't. Most of the time they think anxiety is just being shy. I fricken hate all of this.

It's even worse when they think I hate school because of the learning portion. I love learning! I would rather do it in a safe environment where nobody is forced to speak to me. Nobody once he at school. All the teachers want are money.

Years 
And years
And years and years and years of being in schools that didn't give a crap about me and only cared about my brother even though I was so close to stabbing my arm at times to avoid school.

My new school is much better but the principal scares me. She smiles too much. They all smile too much. It's fake.

The day before I almost skipped lunch because the idea of talking to a drive thru cashier made me start shaking.

I’ve been on Zoloft before years ago. I think my doctor started me on 25 mg before moving me up to 100 and I didn’t feel any side effects ever.

I want to try and feel better as soon as possible, and I know the side effects can last a week or so. Should I lower to 25mg? That being said, I don’t want my original symptoms to come back either. Or would I benefit more from staying at 50.

I start a new job in a week and the idea of being a nauseous shaky mess makes me even more anxious.",2021-09-27 12:13:11

pwbd5i,Need to rant,"A few days ago, my anxiety got the best of me and I went off on a friend while I was trying to conceal that I was having an attack. It made a bit of a scene and led to all the people we were hanging out with leaving.

Tonight I did the same thing. I was with the same group, and was getting completely ignored. Everytime I talked no one listened, or I was talked over. Even if it wasn’t intentional, it made me feel super shit about myself and I began to have a bit of an anxiety attack. I was trying my best to conceal it and was doing a pretty good job at it too. I don’t know why I even entered this situation in the first place, I had a gut feeling it would end like this. I felt like I was super fucking alone and didn’t want to leave because I was too scared they’d talk about me behind my back. 

I waited a solid 5 minutes trying to get a friend’s attention which just enhanced my anxiety and made me feel even shittier. As some of my friends motioned to leave, I got up to go with them, but they proceeded to sit back down, leaving me at the door. I then got ready to leave, but asked them if they were going to which apparently was a major fuck up. They just looked at me and got pissed and then I went off. All my bottled up anxiety came out and I hate myself for it. The friends I was with left with me and told me that I can’t keep doing this, but I don’t know how to stop this. I left them and know they went back to the group and talked about me for an hour straight.

I fucking hate myself for this right now. Just needed to rant and get this off my chest. I don’t know what to do anymore, this shit just keeps getting worse and worse and worse for me.

I’ve realized now too that I smoked the same shit on both of these nights. The first incident was the first time, the second time was last night where I almost had a panic attack but stopped it, the third time was tonight. I’m extraordinarily pissed at myself for not realizing this sooner, and even angrier that I didn’t know that certain types of weed can enhance your anxiety. I’m sorry for anyone who read all of this, I need to get this off of my chest, I hate this so much and it’s having such a god awful effect on my relationships. I burned a lot of bridges tonight and can’t keep this from happening. I don’t know what to do anymore man, I just don’t know what to do anymore.",2021-09-27 11:57:41
pwb7z1,Anyone ever freeze before they have to go somewhere?,Recently work has been getting me down because of a few reasons. Basically I’ve struggled with it mentally. Then one morning as I was getting ready I just couldn’t physically go in. It’s hard to explain but I just couldn’t drag myself in. When I didn’t go in the anxiety only got worse as I’ve had quite a bit of time off recently and I felt so guilty and worried about my career. I mean I hate work some times I find it so difficult to cope with at times. Other times i enjoy it. I am embarrased by the amount of time off I’ve had to have recently.

pwas72,Scared I’m pregnant even though I got my period. I’ll explain why,"So I’m an extremely paranoid person , I got this scared right after watching some tiktok videos about how some girls had regular heavy bleeding but still turned out pregnant even without knowing. Apparently it’s called cryptic pregnancy.
I just got sexually active early this year to my long term boyfriend. In terms of my periods , it can be irregular and light at times but other times it will come out fine. So my first scare was at the end of February when I lost my virginity to him and he came inside when I said no. This was feb 26th and it’s stupid I know and I took the plan b right after which was within 4 hours and we broke up. 
I was extremely paranoid but ended up getting my periods and everything was fine. Periods were regular. Took too many tests all came out fine. 

I didn’t have sex again until the 25th may with a current guy who I’ve been seeing since early April. He made sure I was comfortable and pulled out. I got my period the following month as well but it felt sorta light , so 2 weeks after I took a pregnancy test and it showed I wasn’t pregnant(this was June). However the month of July I didn’t get my period at all and this time took another test and still I wasn’t pregnant and also 25th may was the last time I had sex. Wayy too paranoid after that. So August I got my period TWICE which was the first week on of the month and it still felt light but then 3 and half weeks later I got my period again on the last 7 days of august and this time it was heavy which I felt relieved. (Maybe my July period was a week late hence why I had two periods in august ?)

Btw I’ve had irregular, light and heavy cycles before so it’s not that new but this new fear sucks. I’m due my next period any day now.  Like I said I haven’t had sex since may 25th It’s been ages so idk why I’m worried, these stories I’m seeing on tiktok is making me paranoid, I’m a petite frame but early this year my stomach did gain a bit (before I lost my virginity Btw) so sometimes I think what if it’s not fat but something in me and I just don’t know about it. I’m scared if it’s from may 25th I would be 15 weeks without knowing. And if the time I lost it at feb I would be 28 weeks without knowing. I’m seeing my doctor in 2 weeks when face to face dr appointments start again for the pill(country in lockdown). Please don’t judge me i know it was stupid to have unprotected sex twice, I should have learnt after the first scare. I’m not planning on have sex again until I get on the pill or even at all tbh.

Edit: got slight period like cramping and very lightly bleeding but not a full on period yet. I’m scared I’m hoping its a period",2021-09-27 11:14:21

pwa1xv,How do I get all the bad thoughts about the vaccine out of my head?,"My family is vehemently anti-vax, and keeps talking on and on about a lot of different things. They work healthcare and it makes me sick to my stomach honestly to even think about it. I'm probably going to have to take a Klonopin just typing this out honestly I'm incredibly scared to get the Vaccine.

This is ironic because I had my first dose in early August. Local store keeps calling me to go saying I'll have to restart my shots but a medical article I read said waiting between shots up to three months is more effective but they're saying if I didn't get the second shot end of August that it's ineffective entirely. I thought Canada had massive waits between shots too?

Couple with upping my dose of Lexapro and an eye issue that sort of but didn't resolve that I had happen right after my first shot (going blind in one eye, mostly resolved itself after a few weeks but can't see an eye doctor until October 30th)

I'm not sure what was side effects of the shot, what was from upping my dose, what was from my agoraphobia, what is just GAD, etc,. I'm genuinely freaking out but I'm terrified of getting COVID. I'm 6'5"", 260lbs, up almost forty pounds since starting treatment and I know if I get COVID I'll probably die. I have constant paranoia about being able to breath and I feel like I can't breathe even with my Oxygen being 99% (?). I know it's part of anxiety and panic attacks but the lump in my throat and dry mouth from the Lexapro don't help. I'm just not sure what to do. For the first time in months I was able to spend a few hours outside today before it got bad and I'm terrified of going to the store for my shot but I need to start working again and don't know how to find online jobs with just a HSD. I've been to the doc several times about the breathing they say I'm fine and I can't afford any more bills I can't even pay the medical bills I have they're going to collections and I'm at the point of selling all my studio gear to just pay them off but I've spent years building my collection/mic locker/camera gear. It's awful and I don't know what to do I'm sorry my thoughts are unorganized but I litert don't have anyone to talk to all my friends disappeared over the last few months due to various reasons so all the people I talk to to recharge and mentally feel better are gone and I feel like I'm going crazy in my house like I hate being stuck inside and have to change which room I sleep in every few days and can't even sleep in my bed at all so I'm just wondering what I should do about the vaccine to be able to go get a job and if I need to restart my schedule what all I have to do I don't even know if it's safe everyone says it's not and I'm terrified",2021-09-27 10:22:28

pw9wt4,Help please I don’t know how to make others understand,"Help—Idk how to explain to my boyfriend what it’s like to have social anxiety and depression.  He’s a social butterfly and can’t understand why I am the way I am.  He gets so frustrated with me.  

Tonight, we went to a wedding where he was one of the groomsman and I was not in the wedding party.  I knew little to no people at this party so I was very uncomfortable but did my best to look cheery and happy.  I worked so hard to look comfortable and happy despite being deeply uncomfortable.  I showed up to the wedding at 4 and made it through the ceremony maintaining my composure. But at around 8pm this whole situation started to become too much for me.  

We were seated at the wedding party table and both went to the bathroom and when he came out he didn’t wait for me. Instead he went to go and mingle with friends.  I got out of the bathroom and looked for him but he was no where to be found.  The wedding planner told me to take a seat so the first dance could begin.  

I was back at the table directly behind the couple doing their first dancing with the rest of the wedding party sans boyfriend.  At this point I’m freaking out, everyone at the table is canoodling with their significant other during this romantic song and I’m just there.  Alone.  Trying to make it look like I belong and am super happy because I’m gonna be in the background of all of their photos.  I don’t know these people, I met them 2 days ago.   I finally spot my boyfriend and he has just standing across the floor laughing with his friends as I wave to him to come back to sit and he just stands there laughing with him friends.

After the first dance, I took my purse to go sit inside and compose myself.  I’m on the verge of crying at how awkward I feel.  My boyfriend follows me in and is mad at me about going inside.  I ask him to please leave me alone so I can put myself together but he is getting progressively more and more frustrated with me.     He says my feelings don’t make sense and I continuously say that he can’t understand how I’m feeling but please have some empathy and  don’t get mad at me.  I ask him to please leave me and go rejoin the wedding because he will be missed.  I even try to say maybe we can talk about this in the morning because we have been drinking. I really don’t want to ruin this wedding.  I’m just feeling overwhelmed plus I don’t want everyone to know that I have debilitating anxiety.. He will not leave me alone, he is the kind of person who wants to fix things right there.  He says I’m not explaining how I’m feeling and why and at this point I’m straight up balling because he is getting very frustrated at me.  I have no idea what to do.  

I don’t know how to explain to someone that doesn’t understand what it’s like to have anxiety and he can’t tell when I’m about to go into full on panic mode.  I try to tell in the moment when I’m feeling uncomfortable but he just thinks i can “power through” and then when I can’t he makes me feel bad about leaving the situation and says that i’m ruining the party.  How can I make him understand?",2021-09-27 10:12:21

pw9ndz,Tips for freeway drive tommorow,"Hi guys I am currently super nervous because I am driving an hour away on the freeway to go to the neurologist for my agoraphobia and panic disorder. At least my dad is driving so it will be a little better but I feel it’s going to be really rough

I was wondering if anyone has any tips for calming down my thoughts while on the freeway.

I fear not having off ramps available in long stretches of road and traffic.

My biggest fear is that I will become stuck in traffic and start to panic without a way to get home. I am also afraid that when I’m about 40ish minutes out I will panic because I know it’s a long way to get home. 

I think a big part of me still believes that panic can last forever and can hurt me and I still struggle with the thoughts immensely. 

Any tips or words of advice would be appreciated cause I am really nervous right now.

I have written this a couple days ago but I'm still worried. So, I got the CAT scan (CT scan) with contrast  on Thursday noon. I developed hives over it on Thursday night, which the doc thinks it's a delayed adverse reaction. I took Zyrtec and it went away.

The only thing I'm worried right now is the allergy coming back (cause I've heard it can still happen after a week). My throat is still dry, and I feel like something is inside my throat (like a sore throat). This sore throat started happening on Saturday, and it has been continuing for the last 24-30 hours. I'm not sure if it's getting worse because it has been staying the same.

I'm worried if this is an early symptom of an anaphylactic shock that could cause me not to breathe suddenly. Anyone that can help me out here?",2021-09-27 09:36:25
pw9938,Ate a restaurant!,"I went to a restaurant with some family a few weeks ago and ended up having such a huge panic attack that I hid in the toilets for the majority of the meal. I don't like to cause a scene and any kind of acknowledgement of a panic attack for me makes it much worse. So I just told the family that the food upset my stomach. 

I've had GAD for like 12 years now so I know I avoid certain places and situations if I have had a panic attack there before. So after being on my meds for about 5 weeks I thought it was time to try some exposure therapy. We booked the same restaurant and went to eat there....

I had a lovely meal, didn't have any panic throughout and really enjoyed the experience. Its a relief, and although it was terrifying to even go to the restaurant again, it's proof that I can do it. It's also a reminder that I will never come off my meds again, and that's it's okay if I need them to function, it's just like an iron deficiency.

I’ve been on 1mg of clonazepam 1x a day, and a .5mg on an as needed basis for 15 years now.

I don’t want a higher dose and I honestly want to get off of this medicine. Kinda mad at myself for staying on a benzo for so long. 
I’m no longer agoraphobic but my anxiety is definitely still here. I’m sure it wouldn’t be as bad if my life wasn’t basically in shambles but ehh..

pw8tah,My S/O isn't the best driver and it absolutely triggers my peak anxiety,"And right now I'm typing this to keep Myself distracted as it's a 45 min trip on the interstate with several bridges 
Idk if this is the right place to do this but I figured you'd understand. We went to Hollowscream tonight which was awesome! The scare actors truly are masters of their craft. I think it would be really cool to be one actually! Idk what kind of training you need or prior experience,  I would guess maybe some improv studies or acting background but maybe not! I think if I got the chance I'd be one in costume, something lanky and speedy lol 

The park itself was extremely immersive with the lighting and practical effects and absolutely has an otherworldly vibe. It'd best to experience everything at night time I think though, for obvious reasons. 

They didn't have many scare houses though I think 5 in total but they were all very well planned put and executed.
I couldn't help but admire the costumes and props when I was supposed to be getting the bejesus scared put of me! 
I've never been to Hollowscream before so I didn't know what to expect but I definitely wasn't disappointed and I wanna go back as soon as possible! 

People drive so damn fast on the interstate Holy shit 
So reckless 

This being my first ever spooky experience as an adult really makes me want to experience a tad more extreme haunts, something that can absolutely deny me the leisure or comfort of admiring the art behind it 
I've never really looked into it though, you got any recommendations?

There was this one place I heard of called McKammie manoror something like that where they were borderline torturing the participants, I dunno how into that I am lol just thought ot was note worthy 

Ughhhhjjjj she's going 40 in a 65 
Fuckfyckfuckfuck 
She doesn't take kindly to me saying anything about her driving and honestly it drives me insane it's just so fucking dangerous and I don't understand how she's totally ok with it, like Idk dude, of you aren't comfortable enough to make these trips them we shouldn't like it's fine ugh 

If I say anything though she will snap and drive even more careless 
Anyway shit 

Did you know that an elephant eats up to 100 fruits away while humans require 9?
I learned that at Busch Gardens 
Their massive dudes that's for sure 
We saw them tonight for a little bit 
I wo Der what the animals were thinking about Hollowscream hahaa 
Must've been pretty confusing 

There weren't many animals in their enclosures tonight for obvious reasons but the elephants were because where else could you keep tbem?!

As I was petting a Kangaroo last time we were there during the day I kind of got sad for the little animal dudes who live their whole lives at busch gardens 
Do you think they miss being free? Or were they maybe rescued? Idk 
Seeing the way they all just kind of Lounged made me wonder. 

How would you feel if you got everything you needed and wanted but couldn't leave a cage? Kind of a conflicting thought tbh lol 

Were finally getting off the interstate so imma wrap it 
Sorry to the Mods if this breaks rules and also any typos as it was just rapid fire but I hope it was at least read worthy as ot was definitely helpful

pw8dfy,Working on Overcoming Negative Thinking/Ruminating,"Hey everyone, 

I hope everyone is doing alright. I wanted to gain a bit of a perspective on how I’ve been feeling. COVID has taken a bit of a mental tole, as it has for a lot of people. To sum it up, I was doing great during quarantine. Working from home, staying active, etc. I got to a point where my anxiety went through the roof. I ended up on Lexapro after consulting with a doctor and it left me worse off. I spiraled a bit and I feel as though I still have some PTSD from how it made me feel. I went off cold turkey and really found a good stride moving forward for a while.

Off and on, I’ve felt great and I’ve felt anxious. I’ve consulted with a therapist and even graduated from her program. Negative thinking has been my downfall and I really give myself a hard time, especially when I’m on a longer streak of doing well. I’ve found over the last month or so that I haven’t really been enjoying things as much as I used to. I tend to search and associate other’s mental health with my own and I think I might be generating a habit of being obsessive with how I can get better.

Her birthday is this week and I got her a gift (nothing much, just a fall candle and a t-shirt that reminded me of her that I thought was cute) and I can’t help but think it was dumb and I shouldn’t have given it to her. I keep on thinking that she probably doesn’t like it or I should’ve done something else. This is a perfect example of me worrying over nothing. I feel like the constant worry is ruining my life.

Yesterday was rough. Couldn't get out of bed, worrying about the future, stomach aches, no motivation to finish school work I desperately had to do, pounding headaches from crying. Finally got up at 3 pm, tried to do Doordash to make some money. Drove about a mile, felt my chronic illness start to flare (which I'm convinced anxiety is a major cause of it), turned around and went home. Made no money just wasted gas. 

Today I feel okay, maybe even good. Successfully did a few Doordash orders, now working on homework, albeit a bit hard to focus. 

Yesterday I felt 100% I needed Paxil. I have an old bottle of 10mg pills I was tempted to take (I used to take 40 mg everyday). Today, not so much.

Ever since then I have been having random panic attacks out of no where where my heart start beating fast like pounding like crazy and I literally don’t be doing much like I don’t be excercising or anything it starts beating fast out of nowhere

pw6viv,I’ve begun to notice how hard it’s become to battle anxiety day after day.,"I just need to get some thoughts out. To preface, I’m not saying these things with anger or because I want people to feel bad. These are just thoughts I’ve been having lately while going on my anxiety journey:

Anxiety is extremely hard to battle. Almost every day is mentally rough. The negative, sometimes suicidal, what-if, and self-harm thoughts are sometimes relentless. The suffering in silence makes me feel unworthy of love, grace, support, and care, because sometimes I choose to do so. Not all the time, but sometimes. The fake smiling, joking, and laughing are things that I do to hide my anxiety because I wish people understood, but they don’t so I shouldn’t talk about it. The pressure of trying to be perfect is exhausting some days, both mentally and physically. Yet I hide my anxiety due to fear of becoming vulnerable, and possibly being judged.

I don’t like feeling like everyone is constantly judging me, or that I worry that I’ll do something stupid in front of people. Panic attacks make me feel like I don’t deserve love. Anxiety is not just worrying. It is so much more.",2021-09-27 06:59:07

I wasn’t too confident and my anxiety makes me uncomfortable with uncertainty so I would question everything about the place and the location and the price etc. 

It got to crunch time where I had to make a decision, my brain was telling me yes this ticks the boxes let’s just do it, but whenever I’d try and sit with that decision for even 5mins I’d have a total internal breakdown feeling nervous and scared and anxious. 

It got so bad I eventually had to say no not because I wanted to but because I was scared for my health and couldn’t live like that anymore.  

I feel sad we didn’t get the house now. This isn’t the first time I’ve been crushed by a big decision, it’s happened before when I was trying to pick whether to take a new job or not. 

I talk with my therapist about this, and they usually try to get me to listen to my gut and intuition but this absolutely doesn’t work for me.

pw6eb1,Wondering What On Earth Is Going On With Me (and if anyone else feels the same),"hi! first time using reddit here.

I just wanted to share a bit of what goes on in my mind and see if anyone else relates because I try to google what might be going on with me but nothing feels 100% right.

My mind is always overthinking. I didn't even realize it until people starting calling me funny whenever I described my thought process. That also made me realize how much of a pessimist I am.

In most areas of my life, I'm perfectly fine. But when it comes to relationships and work, I get extremely stressed out to the point of spiraling. It could be mild, but other times it gets so intense that I'm unable to stay present and get really distant or the only way to make it stop is sleep. As I've recognized this pattern, it's gotten worse. A few days ago, I literally had to force myself to sleep to prevent myself from killing myself.

But this is the weird part, all of these spirals only last a couple days tops. And when they're over, either feel like I'm on cloud nine or stable but that's also only for a couple days tops. Sometimes the being distant thing goes on for a few weeks but that's it. Most of the time I feel like I'm living in a state where I'm neither happy nor sad nor empty, just cautiously living. I'm just so confused because all the anxiety and depression disorders seem to be constant but it's not for me, but when I am experiencing feels WAY too intense to be ""sadness"".

I should also mention that I can never be productive for more than a couple days. I'm either procrastinating and practically making myself think about anything other than what I should be doing. OR crunching because I'm mega stressed about the fact I should be doing something productive. Sometimes I'll even be stressed and still procrastinate.

I know that was a lot but I gotta know if anyone else relates or has any advice. Any thoughts are greatly appreciated.",2021-09-27 06:30:08

pw5jpx,advice on anxiety medication,"I hope this doesn't go against the rules. I'll delete it if so. Also TW for anxiety, panic disorder, medication, panic attacks and talk of death. 

For a bit of back story, I've had anxiety since I was 5 years old and was left alone. My anxiety of the jump was panic attacks and less of day-to-day anxiety. Also, my trigger is usually thinking that I'll die. More specifically not having any control over my thoughts anymore and less of physical death. (I'm not trying to get into religion or anything but my thoughts on the afterlife are kind of just ur dead and have no control over anything mentally or physically.) Last year, I had a really bad panic attack one of the worst I've ever had and ended up going to the doctor a couple of days afterward to talk about it. I did get prescribed a  small dose (like 2 or 3 pills) of anxiety meds. (I'm not sure what exactly. ) It was kind of just a last resort thing if no one could control my panic attack. However, I only got the meds because I asked for it and therapy was pushed heavily. My dad kept the prescription and I was told I had to ask him for it. I haven't taken it at all but there were a couple of times I wanted to ask for it. I've talked to him about wanting to keep control over it and take it if I see fit instead of asking him and it would give me a lot of peace of mind. He said he didn't have an issue with it, just that I've never had the pill before and he wants someone around the first time I take it in case I have a bad reaction. That was a few months ago and we haven't really talked about it since. Well, these past few months my anxiety has less and less been about panic attacks where it's now more of day-to-day anxiety. It's been really bad lately. I really want to go on a medication that I take daily because I don't think a pill that will calm me down in a panic attack is helpful as I'm not really having panic attacks. Also, with the therapy thing, I did talk to my uncle who is a professional therapist in the states but I didn't talk to him too much because he was family and I didn't talk with him too frequently. It was more just to get my dad off my back about talking to someone. I am now open to having a therapist I just didn't want it over the phone or zoom I need face-to-face interaction and covid and now school has been in the way a bit. However, it's really annoying me that whenever I talk about wanting to go on medication everyone says therapy first because I've always known my triggers, the cause of my anxiety and how to calm myself down in a panic attack. I get the intentions are pure but for the longest time, I was dead set against getting a therapist cause I had a bad experience when I was younger. So saying I want one now is a big deal for me, but I don't want it to be I can go on medication only if I talk to someone first. 

Does anyone have any advice? How should I ask for medication without firstly getting therapy?

pw5hfy,Why do I get anxiety about people’s responses?,"Somehow this happens with almost everyone I know. It’s usually about how much time they take to respond. For example if they take more than three to four hours to respond, I get anxiety and think they don’t like me anymore. Or if they just don’t respond at all I get worried. I just overthink their responses all the time, I don’t know why. Even if they do respond I think about how they responded and whether it was dry or not. This usually happens more often with online friends, but it even happens with my irl friends. I hate that I have this. I’m sick and tired of being anxious about my friend’s responses all the time when it’s most likely nothing. When people do reply after me overthinking and practically killing myself over it, I get this small high if dopamine. I wait a little to respond and to me, the notification of the text looks so satisfying to me, so I have this thing where I wait to respond so I won’t seem weird. Even when I’m busy doing things, I’m still thinking about the responses. I noticed it’s gotten worse during COVID too. Pre-COVID, I wouldn’t overthink responses nor care whether people even responded to me or not. Now that I’ve been on my phone and other gadgets more often with COVID, I’ve gotten worse with overthinking responses. I hate that I have.

pw55mi,Separating self from mental illness?,"I realize that this is an odd question, but I've been doing some soul-searching lately. Specifically when it comes to my self in relation to my depression and anxiety. I apologize If I'm overthinking this. 

I try and recognize the intrusive thoughts as a separate entity and depression as something happening to me. However, it doesn't seem that clear-cut. I realize that the internal dialogue is a different voice from the real me, but at the same time I also feel like to some extent these thoughts are part of me. 

Sometimes I sort of feel like there's a possibility that these thoughts are just what I want to do or say. When I'm talking to people I care about and I can hear my brain yelling spiteful or violent comments, but maybe that's just how I truly feel? Maybe I'm actually super cynical, angry and pretty unpleasant. My actions don't reflect that, but possibly I'm acting how I think I'm supposed to, rather than just being me. Maybe we're all naturally violent or hateful but norms and values keep this at bay? 

Maybe I exhaustively think about this because I care, but at the same time this internal conflict keeps going. Like I'm split in two. I can't decide which me is actually me.  All I know is that I've dug myself into a bit of a hole.",2021-09-27 05:15:04

pw49b7,I am struggling with anxiety and self harming/suicidal thoughts,"If you come across this post please, I beg you, read until the end.

Hello, yesterday I broke up with my boyfriend who I also consider my bestfriend. My life is not going very well at the moment and I feel like this was kinda the last straw. He told me he has some problems with his mental health and feels like he needs some time to himself. He says that if he can not care for me (because of the state he is in) then there's no point in staying together. To give some context we started as fuck buddies right after he broke up with his ex and then got into a serious relationship but have never said ""I love you"" to each other. He told me that he is feeling insecure about our relationship because of this as well. I feel like I am not enough for him even though I am putting my heart into this relationship. I feel so insecure because he loved his ex so much... I often ask myself what do I not have that she does? I admit that I am not a very easy person to deal with since I come from a past of emotional trauma and abuse and feel unconforable doing various things like complimenting him and saying he looks cute and so on. This and some other behaviors bother him but are not the cause of the way he is feeling. I am feeling very overwhelmed by this whole situation given the fact that I do not have a job and my family is really struggling financially. I've been finding myself having thoughts about self harm and have had various anxiety attacks where I feel like I have a huge weight on my chest and can't breathe or breathe rapidly. I have not eaten anything in 2 days and I feel like if I were to eat I would throw up.
To top it all off he also said that he was scared to break up with me because of my current suicidal thoughts. When he said this I felt horrible, I felt that even without meaning it I've been manipulating him. I feel horrible, I don't know what to do but I know for a fact that I can't go on like this. He is the only joy in my life and I think that if I were to actually lose him I wouldn't be able to cope.He told me to give him some time but I don't know if I can hold on that long. I feel like I've lost a piece of my heart. I wrote this on a whim since I don't have any friends apart from my boyfriend. Leaving aside this situation I also can't find a job because there aren't any where I'm leaving and can't afford university. I don't know what to do with my life I feel like I don't have any perspectives. All I am thinking about in the last two days are dark thoughts about how maybe harming myself will alleviate this pain which I know it won't but it seems like I can't think rationally right now.",2021-09-27 04:22:51

pw452d,Anxiety made me miss the last year of my papas life.,"My papa caught COVID and passed away on his 9th day being symptomatic. August 29th, 2021. 

Rewind to 2020…I had a miscarriage and developed an extreme panic disorder that made me go though extensive DBT therapy, lots of med trials and individual therapy. This anxiety caused me to be almost completely house ridden. I had to quit my job, I was luckily doing school online so that was my only outlet. Panic attacks were almost daily. Over the last year (March 2020-March 2021) I saw my grandparents MAYBE 10/20 times. They live 20 mins away. 

Almost every time I went over I was anxious and always rushing to get home. I didn’t mean to be. My papa was my best friend. The last time I saw him, we went to pick out shoes together. When I was heading back to his house, he requested that we go out to lunch. I didn’t want to, but I didn’t tell him that. I said “ok let’s go pick up grandma”. So we went to their house, asked if she wanted lunch and she replied, “I already ate.” He was kind of upset. I said that I had to do some things and that I needed to leave but he was disappointed. So, I said, you know what, those things can wait. Let’s go! So we went. He has dementia so I doubt he remembered that conversation, but I do. I hope he knew that I liked him. I hope he knew that I loved him. I hope he knew that he was my best friend. We went on that lunch date August 9th. He passed away 20 days later. 

The point of this post is that I feel that I missed out on so much time I could have spent with him.  I regret not going over there more often. I am ashamed that my anxiety took such a strong hold onto my life. I am so lucky that I got to spend time alone with him the last time I saw him. I am grateful that I have had 25 years with him. I just miss him so fucking much and I wish COVID didn’t have to take him away. He deserved better than a covid death. He took his last breath in the hospital, with my mother holding him. Maybe it is a blessing. I will say, that with his dementia getting pretty bad, he never forgot us. 

I just want him to know that I will never forget him. I think about him EVERYDAY. I just wish I could have one more moment with him. He was my best friend. And will always be my best friend.",2021-09-27 04:15:43

pw3ihp,"Burnout, restlessness, frustration?","I was just wondering how people ""turn it off"" effectively, and if there is such a thing, and how to do it. 

I'm in my first year of university, just broke it off with someone I was seeing, and am overwhelmed with financial burdens and challenges. 

I know it's really important to blow off steam, to ""turn it off"", to relax in different ways but for me my tried and true methods don't even work anymore. 

I used to game, lift weights, smoke, drink, enjoy a movie or TV show, or jump into a cold shower - I always had these things I could do to make myself ""turn it off"". Whatever it was I was made uneasy by I could relax into the normalcy of these pass times. 

I think a lot of it may be heightened due to finally returning to my education and remote learning and  being able to do work anywhere anytime continuously also puts pressure on you anywhere anytime that you should be working. Covid makes your house life and your school life inseparable. 

I haven't been able to turn it off or enjoy things or find peace for a long time, and even those things that I build up in my head as these sure-fire go to's whenever I wanna feel okay don't work. 

Is it something physical? Is the stress too much for my regular practices? Am I doing something wrong? Why do the things I used to do to blow of steam not work anymore, and what can I do in their place?

It's a nice little box that folds into different shapes and it makes a very satisfying noise when it locks into place. I also got a tiny game remote with a bunch of buttons, a joystick, and some other little trinkets that you can fidget with.

pw38zu,Hello I need some advice on what to do in this situation?,"Basically its been almost 4 weeks since we have been back in school since the summer holidays and I have hardly done any of the work for one of my subjects and I barely know the teachers so I'm really anxious and nervous to go up to them and tell them  my reasons.

And I really don't want to get kicked out of the 6th form I go to for not completing my work.

So I'm thinking of telling my problems to this other perosn who is not a teacher of mine for that subject but he is like the assistant head of house  for the 6th form I  go to and I've had him as a teacher before so I'm more comfortable telling him my problems.

Basically my reason for not doing the work is bascially a close family member of mine who I loved  very much died during the holidays and I thought that I could just go back to school and do my work and just be like I was before the holidays and before this family member died but it as turned out to be harder than I thought going back to school acting like nothing happened or acting like I'm fine or that I can still do my work.

And I also have some other personal problems that have affected me and my capabilities in doing my work but that family member dying is one if the biggest things that have affected my work quality.

I am not sure if I should post this question here but here it goes. I have had anxiety since college but this month has been terrible. I am constantly anxious and emotional. It is interfering with my daily life. I am irritable as well and get angry very quickly. I think I have every psych condition I read about and it is making it even worse. My psychiatrist put me on buspar which is some what keeping the anxiety down but its still very much there. He tried to put me on wellbutrin since it has worked for me in the past but I stopped taking it once I found out I was pregnant. However this time around it made me even more anxious and I stopped taking it after three days. I know the next logical step is an SSRI.

pw2zvd,Advice for not always getting anxisty at places I usually do,"Hey guys! I am I’m on the back end of a big anxiety stint (thank god). Though I am still avoiding places where I have had anxiety attacks, for example I have some streets I don’t drive down any more, I am still frightened to walk on the beach for a long period of time and now I’m beginning to have anxiety when I am going on my morning jog.

The beach and the streets don’t bother me, as I’m not a beach person and I can drive other ways to work. I am just really disappointed now I feel it when on my morning run. I love running, it clears my head and makes me feel really good and is my way of keeping in shape. I have attributed the anxiety to sensory overload when I’m running, there is usually a lot of people around, a lot of noises and smells. I do not suffer social anxiety though *** 

I see a psychologist and she has said to feel the thoughts that come in my head and say reassuring statements, to ground myself by focusing on my feet hitting the ground as I run. I find this all too overwhelming and usually end up calling someone as my escape route (this always makes me feel better).

I need some advice on what I can do, I don’t want to feel like this every time I go to the place where I run in the mornings, I am worried that even if I change location it will be the same result and anyway I love the place that I run and I don’t want to stop going there altogether.

Usually when I run I will listen to music up until I feel anxious than call someone or I will switch to a podcast. This morning even though I was on the phone to someone I was just too overwhelmed and had to turn back.",2021-09-27 03:09:48

In February I moved in with two guys I know (but I wouldn't call them friends though). The flat is actually one of this guys mom's so she is our landlord. Stupidly I signed a contract for a whole year.
It was all right at first but then I realised how unhappy I was there, the boys were not cleaning after themselves or taking care of anything, they were living ""students life"" and since I started working it's been problematic for me.
For the last few months I felt so anxious around the house that I couldn't even leave my room. Now im paying for that room but I'm spending most of the time at my parents house.
But I found a cute and affordable place, all for myself. I've already contacted the owner and I can move in November. But the problem is that technically I have a valid contract at that previous place until February 2022. I'd have to call the landlady and ask her to terminate the contract and let me go earlier. 
But I feel so anxious to call her, I am terrified that she won't be happy with my decision or even say that I cannot move out earlier. Do you please have any tips on how to find strength to make this conversation?",2021-09-27 02:25:04

pw1jae,Sudden onset panic after years of manageable anxiety.,"I don’t know what I’m looking for in posting this but I want to anyway. 
I am 27f, a bit overweight but otherwise healthy and active. Since I was in high school I’ve had manageable anxiety, no panic attacks ever, just typical anxieties day to day that I could usually quiet through meditation or exercise. On Sept 14, I had a full fledged panic attack and thought my heart was going to stop, my husband took me to the hospital where I was told it was anxiety and that my heart and everything else was fine. I was also given a prescription for Xanax, .5mg, that I have since taken 4 pills of. Since that first panic attack on the 14th I have had daily panic attacks lasting for hours, sometimes all night long. All of these attacks revolve around me thinking my heart is about to give out or that I’m going to stop breathing. That worry coupled with the physical symptoms of anxiety(shortness of breath and rapid heart rate) are keeping me in this state of constant fear and panic. I went to my regular doctor yesterday and she told me that I’m basically in perfect health and that made me feel better when I was in the office but the moment I left the panic set back in. I guess I’m looking for reassurance. The fact that this has set on so suddenly and nothing has been able to mitigate it is keeping me in that state of worry. I haven’t been able to go to work or really even go outside because I’m so scared. Nothing in my life has changed to trigger this anxiety. Has anyone else had this happen to them? I’m sorry for any spelling or grammar errors…anxiety.",2021-09-27 01:51:10
pw13c4,I’ve been pushed over the edge today. I’m sick of my parents for a million reasons and I want to leave ASAP (I’m 18 and graduated HS),"TRIGGER WARNING: discussion of imagined injury to infants in the section with asterisks.

First, to be clear, my parents take good care of me and don’t hurt me, but I can’t be around them. It’s all mental and emotional. My mom has an unspecified mood disorder, probably  Bipolar, and my dad is easily angered/depressed. They used to fight almost every night, but it’s less frequent now since my dad stopped drinking. However, when my mom gets really upset she will scream that she wants a divorce or that she’s going to move back to Costa Rica by herself. That happen this morning. A while later I was watching tv with my dad.
********
We were watching a car commercial and started talking about car safety. He told me how a woman was holding a baby in the back of a car against her chest with the seatbelt over the baby. He proceeded to graphically talk about what would happen to the baby if a car accident happened. I was like “please don’t describe it like that”.  He kinda laughed and KEPT DOING IT. I told him firmly to stop and he described something truly horrific happening to a baby that I won’t repeat here. 

********

   
   He laughed at how upset I was getting. This happens sometimes. He think it’s so fucking funny to make me upset. My mom was in the other room and started laughing as i began to cry and yell at my dad to stop. I was standing there crying and both of them were just laughing. I felt so humiliated. Das was like “why are you upset? It didn’t really happen”  My mom was like “you’ve been really sensitive today. go take a nap”. (something happened with my mom too before that I’ll get to it later). I lost it and screamed at my dad “DON’T FUCKING TALK TO ME”.  I never ever scream the way I did then, but I was furious. I began to hyperventilate and ran into my room. I was losing it at this point. I’ve had anxiety attacks before but this was different. I just started shrieking while I was crying. I put my face down on my desk and just wailed and hyperventilated. 
   
   The only ever time I had a reaction like that was a few months ago when I got into an argument with my mom. I wanted to hurt myself and tried to call the suicide hotline, then my mom knocked on the door and I started screaming cause I thought she was gonna try to spank me or yell at me more. (I ended up going to a psychiatric hospital for 5 days) 

I can ’t believe my parents did this to me. They were so disrespectful of my feelings I couldn’t believe it. My teen brother is a real one though, he didn’t laugh at all and hugged me when I was crying. A lot of other shit happened before that too, this was just the last straw I guess. I’ll leave a comment with more details. 
   I usually keep my parents at arms length because my mom is bipolar and my dad is super conservative and doesn’t like most of the things I like. Lately, though, I was trying to get closer them cause “family is forever” or whatever people say. That’s down the drain now. I don’t hate them, but I’d like to get away from them ASAP. It’s not like they abuse me. They love me and take care of me 90% of the time. It’s just so many little things that have piled up over the years. My parents argue all the time. Also, and this is a big one, I am trans and neither of them would accept me if they knew. I have every right to believe that if I started medically transitioning they would have nothing to do with me.


tldr; today a lot of things happened and pushed me over the edge. I want to move out ASAP. 

I don’t have money, but I graduated high school in spring and i have a car and a learners permit. I’m thinking that if I get can manage to works two fast food/retail job I’ll be out of the house for a much longer time and I’ll make more money so I can move out ASAP. Also, I don’t have any friends I can stay with.
Any advice for me to be able to leave faster would be appreciated.",2021-09-27 01:27:31
pw12ub,Anxiety over lump in leg,"Anyone have health anxiety? 

I’ve had a lump in my left thigh for awhile now. Probably 5+ years. It’s firm, doesn’t move, seems like it’s slowly growing. I’ve had a few doctors feel it and look at it but never seemed too concerned. 

I made the mistake of Googling and everything popped up about sarcomas (cancer) and the more I read about it the more I’m convinced I have it. 

I asked my doctor about an MRI and they said they don’t think it’s necessary. 

My doctor referred me to physical therapy instead. (I have no idea why) But doctor thinks maybe it’s scar tissue or something to do with the fascia. 

I’m wondering if I should see another doctor or a specialist. 

I can’t stop worrying about it. The anxiety this is causing is absolutely awful.",2021-09-27 01:26:49

Even went to a Neurologist who conducted all the tests :( can symptoms last this long after panic attacks, and when my body was high on anxiety? I am still googling symptoms and coming up with new problems… 🥺 right now I am having jaw issues(TMJ), headaches, tense muscles and tingling and parathesia all over my body… was diagnosed by my Neuro with BFS(Benign Fesiculation Syndrome), as some of my body just twitches randomly..",2021-09-27 01:15:44

1. Dont feel like I can do it
2. ""Must be able to work well under pressure and in a fast-paced environment""
3. Nothing looks interesting

pw0o1p,dancing against anxiety,"just wanted to share this because it helped me so much this evening. i was sitting at the couch doing nothing and noticed that my anxiety increased without any reason and yeah ... im still bad at stopping a panic attack (especially since i stopped drinking, because that was my coping mechanism). so i went to my room and threw up a stress ball and catched it really fast for like 10 minutes because that helps a bit but it didnt stopped the panic attack.

 so i put in headphones and turned on really loud and catchy music like the one that is played in clubs and danced. i danced for ... idk lol 30 minutes? i mean i REALLY danced i jumped and such things lol and i guess it looked really weird but who cares. i fucking felt the music and couldnt think about anything. it was awesome because guess what? my anxiety was gone and when i stopped i felt soooo good. you may know that you release a lot happiness hormones while dancing so it really helps.

 like i said just wanted to share, maybe it helps some if you :))",2021-09-27 01:04:17
pw0mxj,Anxiety with working,"My anxiety prevents me from working and getting a job. I’m 20 and have never had a job. Not having a job was never a problem since I was always active in sports that consumed 6-7 days of each week, so I never had the opportunity. In the summers, I still would row and go to regattas but I also loved having time away from school and sports in the summer and used that time for vacations and having fun. 

I’m now in my sophomore year of college and have only 2 in person classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays, the rest I opted for online. I have a lot of down time that I try to fill with seeing my boyfriend but he also works, so it’s not always as much as I’d want to. I already miss him a lot when we’re apart so I know I need to be more proactive. I’ve started back at the gym a bit which was hard and still is but I want to get into a groove and be healthier, body and mind. 

In august, I got my first job at a gym at the front desk and working with kids. It was okay and my anxiety was very prevalent, but I managed the best I could. I ended up quitting after a week after having a male coworker constantly flirt and grab my waist as a way to funnily scare me, which it wasn’t at all. Instead of being upfront about my reasonings, I told my boss that I found a better job that was in my career path and needed to take it. In hindsight, I should’ve told the truth because no coworker should treat another coworker the way I was being constantly uncomfortable. This solidified my fears to not work and I just can’t see myself with a job like that yet. 

I’m in school to be a young kids teacher which I know won’t give me much anxiety since I love children but all the jobs available to me are ones I am not interested in and give me a lot of anxiety thinking about it. I’ve tried daycares but because I’m a student and can’t work full time, they can’t hire me. Babysitting is always too sporadic when I’d rather have a set schedule and nannying conflicts with my schooling. 

Right now, I would love to have a remote job since that’s all I feel I could manage right now. I know I also need to be saving money since there’s so much I want to achieve in life but I feel incapable. I’m working on improving my mental health but I know it’ll be a slow process so until then I guess a job that doesn’t require much seems the best to me.

I live at home still so I’m reliant upon my parents for everything and when I’m with my boyfriend, I’m reliant on him for things too. I don’t want to feel like a burden to people anymore and I want to be more self sufficient since the plan is to rent an apartment off campus either next semester or my junior year. Since I am fortunate enough that my parents can provide that for me, I want to prove to them that I can also provide for myself and make my own money but I genuinely don’t feel ready for a real job. 

If anyone has any jobs that are low anxiety jobs or ones that I can start online I would greatly appreciate it!! Just needed to vent and maybe get some advice :)",2021-09-27 01:02:38

pw0hoi,"I just need to hear that i can do this and everything will be ok, maybe some advice please!","I'm in the process of helping my elderly, disabled dad move. He's not allowed to bring his cat with him to where he is moving, so i am taking her.

I have always been a cat lover and I've wanted a cat again for years. I've held off though because I've been raising a family and i didn't want to bring a cat home to 2 toddler girls who would absolutely love the cat, but might stress her out. She's used to living in a quiet retirement community and my house is the typical toddler household still. My girls are currently 3 and 4.

I'm having a TON of anxiety over bringing the cat home. I'm worried I'm going to ruin this cats nerves. When my dad first brought her home with him all she did was hide and run from every noise. It took her months to get fully comfortable and she's still not fond of strangers. My kids aren't strangers to her, and she's ok with them when they're calm. But when the kids get rowdy the cat gets scarce.

We can't find another better home for her right now. I don't feel comfortable taking her to the shelter, i love her. I've talked to my kids as much as you can about it to a 3 and 4 year old. They are excited to have her. 

Do you think she will adjust? She's 5 now. She likes affection. She just doesn't like noise. My house isn't that big, its just one floor of an average sized house. Do you think she will do ok? Does anybody have any tips on helping the cat adjust? Or am i overreacting because of my anxiety?",2021-09-27 00:55:12

For a while, even with this amount of anxiety, I've stayed positive, hopeful, and very excited about getting this over with, but now it's scary. My anxiety is very crippling. I am obsessed with my heart. That it's going to beat too fast, fall out of rhythm, stop, etc. This means I can't experience anxiety or excitement without getting even more anxious.

I have tried therapy, reading books, deep breathing, meditation, exposure, etc. but I'm so TIRED! So exhausted. I gave in and started Zoloft, but I'm worse.

I've had some health issues lately that have made life a bit more difficult. Work has been a lot more stressful, marriage has been stressful, and to top it off, my wife is pregnant. There is a lot going on right now.

A couple weeks ago, while I was driving, my body started to get warm and tingly, my breathing almost felt like I wasn't getting enough oxygen, and I felt just uneasy overall. I thought I had having another stroke initially but it was full body and only lasted a few minutes with no other stroke-like symptoms.

I talked to my therapist about it. She thinks I had a panic attack. I tend to agree. She gave me a couple techniques to try but we haven't gotten around to discussing meds yet.

Sorry if I'm rambling but I have these couple questions.
1) Does it sound like I had a panic attack?
2) Can you have a panic attack randomly? As in you aren't in a particularly stressful situation but you have panic attack symptoms anyway?

I'm going to ask my doc about meds maybe. It's hard to decipher whether what's going on is related to mental health or the stroke I had or an oncoming stroke or the heart issues I have. It's all overwhelming.",2021-09-26 23:17:19

It first started last year when I was in school and having chest pain. I googled and convinced myself that I was having a full blown heart attack and thought I was dying and that gave me an anxiety attack.

Didn’t have any for a while until about 2 months ago where I convinced myself I had diabetes, this made me have an anxiety attack too. (I did not have diabetes)

About a month ago, I had pain and convinced myself that I was having a stroke. This sent me into a such a bad anxiety attack that my mom got scared and carried me to the hospital.

Last night I had a headache and subsequently convinced myself that I was having a brain aneurysm. I then had an anxiety attack that I was dying.

pvy1v3,Last night my heart rate was at 170 BPM while resting.,Last night was absolutely terrifying and the first experience I’ve had with what I assume to be an anxiety attack. I came home around midnight after having some drinks with friends. I was feeling pretty tired so I took a quick shower and hopped into bed. Once in bed my mind started racing (as it usually does) so I tossed and turned a bit. I also noticed that my heart rate seemed to be a bit high (minor palpitations). I decided to get on my Reddit and mindlessly scroll since I couldn’t sleep. As I was scrolling on my phone I kept noticing my heart rate being elevated so I decided to get up and take some deep breaths. I began pacing around the room when the shit hit the fan. My heart rate kept going faster and faster and the more I tried to relax the worse it got. I began to panic so I woke my brother up (it was about 2am) thinking I might need to go to the ER. Immediately upon talking to him my HR came down to about 125 which is obviously still quite high. I spent the next 3 hours laying on the sofa and just trying to rest/relax. My heart rate for the remainder of the evening hovered around 100 BPM before eventually falling asleep. Fast forward today and I’m feeling pretty terrible. Anxiety is still high as I’m worried about last nights experience. A lot of questions going through my mind… was this purely anxiety induced or perhaps a medical issue with my heart? Is this going to happen again? Why did it happen last night for the first time if I’ve always had anxiety? Heart rate today is around 85 BPM which is within normal range but still high for me. Any advice/tips on what my next steps should be would be greatly appreciated.

I’ve never gotten really sick from food (knock on wood), but the idea haunts me.

 I had a panic attack once when I cooked chicken tenders for myself because I thought it was undercooked/spoiled, even thought the meat was fine and I checked the internal temperature like 5 times. My dad talked some sense into me and for like 5 years I don’t really think about it. 
  The fear resurfaced recently, probably because I listened to a podcast and they started talking about how sick they all got from fast food pizza. Now the idea is stuck in my mind. It’s just the fact that it’s happens to so many people, and that it can come from basically ANYTHING. Greens have E. coli. Meat and eggs have salmonella. Canned things can have botulism. Who knows if this lunch meat was handled properly? Am I REALLY sure that the groceries are still safe, even though it was only in the trunk for an hour? 

   I cook for myself mostly, but that seems to make the fear a lot worse. (But now I am suspicious of restaurants as well.) I used to have no fear about what I ate, but now I have to sniff everything to make sure it isn’t sour. Am I sure that this sandwich meat isn’t old? Am I sure that this lettuce doesn’t have E.coli in it. (I love Taco Bell, actually, but cross my heart I will never step foot into a Chipotle in my life. Like over 100 people got actual food poisoning from that place why the fuck do people go there )  

Last night and this morning I used salad greens that were wilty and kinda wet but still 4 days away from expiring. “Prewashed” but I still rinsed them. I ate a sandwich with the greens and meat that I sniffed and tasted to make sure it was safe. But as soon as my stomach gurgled/started settling, it’s like a switch flips in my brain and I start thinking “oh god this is it. Its gonna hurt so so bad. I have e. Coli. Oh god the meat /was/ off. What if I I have to go to the hospital??” I started panting and my hands got clammy. Last night, I forced myself to vomit and kept hyperventilating. Every little feeling I had in my stomach was a sure sign that something I ate was bad. 
    I calmed down and thought “oh wait it’s not that bad.” But even hours later, if I have any kind of pain in my stomach I get freaked out again. (I really screwed myself over once I read online that it can hit you up to 15 hours later.) I’m in the bathroom now and my stomach is hurting again. I ate breakfast about 2 hours ago. Trying not to cry. I’m so terrified of the pain that could be coming.

TLDR. How do I prevent myself from getting sick? What can I do to reassure myself that I won’t be sick now or later? I don’t want to live my life this way. Any help is appreciated.",2021-09-26 22:18:48
pvxfsm,Anxiety & OCD Flare Up,"I’ve been going through a “rough patch” with my anxiety and OCD especially with the intrusive thoughts. They mess me up the most because they’re things I DON’T want to do and scare the hell out of me which then causes my anxiety to turn on full force. I don’t like not feeling like me. I tend to be that happy and always laughing person and I thrive feeling that way. So, to constantly wake up and feel anxious and have my OCD throwing random intrusive thoughts in my head is terrifying. I’ve had a lot of changes since April that have been stressful. I work in veterinary medicine as a tech and we’ve been overrun and overworked lately and I’m a manager of the surgery department. People are constantly freaking out to me over issues lately. My boyfriend and I just moved into a house together in July which was a huge step. When I’ve done that in the past in relationships it’s never been a good time and I have PTSD from relationships. I don’t feel like my house is home yet. I’ve been petsitting back to back all summer and now that I’m finally home my boyfriend is traveling for work. I’m mentally drained from the pandemic I just want it to be over. My friends are all not in the best head space right now and my best friend is being super negative and dragging me down. 

BUT, I’ve made this changes currently. I’ve been seeing my therapist weekly for the past 6 weeks. I had an appt with my psychiatrist and he bumped up my lexapro and klonopin temporarily to help get me over this rough patch. I deleted Facebook so I wouldn’t have to see negative posts. I started a membership at a gym so I can run and work out some of this physical nervous energy I feel and stress from work. I’ve cut back on caffeine. 

Basically I’m just venting and want this rough patch to be over so I can go back to feeling myself again. Thanks for reading my rant if you did",2021-09-26 22:13:16

pvx5ga,Anxiety is killing all my pleasures,"I am a 20 yo male, living in Europe, diagnosed with anxiety and moderate depression. I discovered my situation very recently, after a period in which an ever increasing amounts of bad thoughts started crossing my mind. I talked to my parents about this and I am now undergoing medication and counseling.

I used to be very different from what I am now. I used to travel, go out with friends quite often, go study in a library, stay at home alone for a few weeks without any fears. I used to love driving, making new experiences and so much more. Now I constantly have thoughts about something bad happening. I can't stay at home without thinking that there might be thieves wanting to enter my house or someone pointing a gun at me. I can't go and drive around without fearing that if someone were to cut me off and I honk at him, he might get out of the car and hurt me. I can't go out at night even with friends, because I am afraid that if I were to cross someone's eyes they might start a fight. I can't go to the car wash without thinking that someone will want to steal my car and do so in a violent way.

My situation is affecting me in so many different ways: I have a hard time studying, even though I have taken my mind off university for a whole month and I have selected courses I am really enjoying (I have never thought about leaving uni, getting a degree is just too important for me); I would love to get a motorcycle's license, but what's the point if then I am afraid to go out?; I rarely see my friends anymore and even though I explained this situation to them and my psychologist suggested to try and go out with them (which I have done very recently and I felt very well) I just can't imagine a return to a version of me without depression. I have always been anxious before taking a test or when doing something relevant for the first time, but this is way beyond anything I've ever felt. I am also extremely rational and I often read about how we're living in the safest period of human history, the world is getting safer year by year, the rate of homicides and wars is declining steadily. Reading this makes me feel good, but only for a very short period of time (minutes) whereas I used to have an extremely positive outlook about the world if I were to read the same information.

Has anyone felt the same way about these topics? How long will this go on? I want to take my life back. I read a lot of posts where people are anxious about public speaking, but almost none about being anxious of people's behavior like in my case. Thanks",2021-09-26 21:57:46

Today, I'm paralyzed by what this week will bring me. Quarter end with two huge presentations that I'm unprepared for in front of the CEO and exec staff just this week alone. Big code releases with my stamp of approval, etc etc. Ugh. Combined with my family relying on me to provide, I feel like I'm slowly suffocating.
The sleepless nights, constant debilitating anxiety and panic episodes are too much for me to bear anymore. I need to speak up and say something but I'm terrified that it'll backfire and I'll lose career momentum. These aren't the kind of people you show weakness to. What the hell have I gotten myself into?
Working around these seemingly-confident executives has made feel like the problem is with me, but I'm starting to ask myself if I want any of this. I need time to decompress and reassess. I'm feeling compelled to ask for a week off for a mental health break just so I can stop and breathe, but I'm sheepishly fearing the stigma of it.

pvw6io,Why is it that everytime i try to avoid stuff that i KNOW will make me depressed/angry/etc. i get anxious?,"This is a bit complicated to explain, but here's an example: let's say i'm in love with this guy and he gets a girlfriend. My friends find out and tell me. Obviously i'll be hurt but if i go to his instagram and see their pictures together, it'd hurt me even more, right? So you think ""well, just don't go to their instagram then"" and that's the thing. When i start trying to avoid something that i don't wanna see, i start getting anxious about it and i have no clue why. The anxiety only goes away after i do whatever i've been avoiding. It's like my brain WANTS me to see it and get hurt so it can be at peace afterwards for some reason??
 
What prompted me to ask this is that youtube keeps recommending me this video about a topic that i know will get me angry (specially if i go to the comment section) so i'm avoiding it but now i'm anxious because of it. Part of me is like ""go and see it, someday you will anyway so you can just get it over with now"" but why when i can simply AVOID IT? Why won't my brain let me avoid stuff??

pvv45b,Heart Jumping When Deep Breathing,"Hey guys,

I'm 32, healthy and relatively in shape. I just ran a battery of exams and my heart is fine according to the cardiologist, but he wasn't much of a talker and as such I couldn't talk much about my problems.

&#x200B;

Quick weird question, does it happen to you guys when you exert yourself really hard and your heart rate goes up (as it should) that sometimes you get a heart jump (ectopic beat maybe or something similar in feeling) when you deep breathe? I get them only when I deep breathe and I only have one at the time I deep breathe. 

&#x200B;

Either when running fast (mostly after while recovering) or cycling fast (mostly at recovery) I get that feeling, even sniffling hard (because of running in cold weather) gives me one sometimes...  


I'm an anxious person, diagnosed with GAD and lately my heart has been too much the center of my attention, I won't deny it... And this might have come from some building up in my head for sure.

Doctor didn't even care about it, so I assume it's not bad, but still I'm curious to know if I'm the only one feeling this.

Thanks for your time

pvukfk,Dorm Life Anxiety = Hearing Critical Voices,"Me: (Socially awkward, weak social skills, bad communication skills, verbally inarticulate)

A recipe for social disaster.

It's unavoidable living in a dorm because many spaces are shared and bathrooms are communal by gender.

During Week 0, everyone would greet each other and get to know one another. I managed to meet a few people but it got all too much and I shut down. Meaning.. I avoided making eye contact in fear and dread of potential small talk questions. You know, the nice pleasantries that help start friendships. Even when we start talking, I don't know what to say or ask. Super awkward. I fear I come across as disinterested and rude.

Now I feel everyone hates me.

It has gotten so bad that I can hear people call me negative curse words under their breath or aloud at me.

Whenever people walk past me or interact with me, I hear them call me a b**** or w**** or h**. Idk if it is real or imagined. So after any time in public (going to dining halls, eating, walking to class), it's incredibly stressful. I've already cried so many times too, embarrassing to admit.

Some people even lowered their masks temporarily to mutter an obscenity at me, then quickly raise it. Idk who they are, even.

The worker who swipes us in at the dining hall also called me an obscenity. I wanted to make sure so I asked ""Sorry?"" but she gave me a straight stare with a knowing smile as if she said what she said and meant it.

I understand not everyone will like me. Same vice versa. And that everyones busy with their own lives and dont give two cents about me. but i cant help feeling like theyre talking about me or abhor every single atom that makes up me.

But I feel like an outcast and everyone just hates me. I haven't done anything, at least not that I am aware. But I keep hearing people reply to me with profanities.

I also feel constantly judged and scrutinized 

For example: lets say myself or the other person on my floor or strangrr will hold the door open for me/them/him/her, If i say thank you, the other person replies yes or no problem the says the b or h word at me. Is this imagined?

If its not imagined then i must be doing something wrong or did something wrong. cause if an entire floor of peers all think im a b or h, then.. the problem probably is with me right?

Idk what to do. Some strands of hair turned white on my head from stress lol...  I get teary all the time. And classes only just started..!!! 

I want to focus on classes but this is so difficult for me. do you have any tips or insights on this?

i kinda wonder if its sensory overload from there being so many people around all the time. country girl inna city kind of thing. but it just.. their voices are so real. i think they are real T-T",2021-09-26 19:39:37

pvu09m,"Breathing anxiety / worried I can't breathe, even though I am breathing","Ever since Covid began, I developed this huge anxiety around being able to breathe. I'll be so worried I won't be able to breathe, while I'm sitting there breathing, or worried that I can't inhale enough of a breath, or that I'm suddenly going to be unable to breathe. It usually doesn't afflict me during the day, but it plagues me greatly at night when I'm trying to fall asleep or any other moments when I'm trying to just relax and not do anything. When I am not preoccupied with something, my mind won't rest and I'll start overthinking my breathing. I'll lay there for so long worried I'm not able to breathe well enough, even though I'm laying there breathing the same as I always have. Rationally, I know I'm breathing and I'm fine, but I can't stop myself from worrying.

When the pandemic first hit, for the first couple of months it plagued me every night and during the day when I was alone. When I first woke up, it felt like I was on the verge of a panic attack because I felt so anxious about being able to breathe. It gradually grew less intense, and it hasn't really affected me so much for a while until now. Today, while trying to fall asleep, I was right on the edge of falling asleep when the anxiety suddenly hit me and I found myself overanalyzing my breathing. I must've just laid here for twenty minutes worried I'm not able to breathe well enough before I decided to post here.

What can I do to alleviate this anxiety? I even went to the doctor a couple weeks ago for a regular checkup, and when he checked my breathing, he said it was good and didn't have anything remarkable to say. Despite that, I'm still feeling this way.",2021-09-26 19:08:25

I need to leave to try and bring myself back to reality. The world isn’t as bad as my brain wants me to think.

Big surgery coming up which has really been playing on my mind. Suicidal thoughts have been hitting me hard. I need to ground myself.

I’m going to take some time off work and try to focus on more productive activities instead of social media which are a drain on me.

I would like to thank all of you. I wish you all the best in life. Anxiety disorders truly are hell to deal with.

Like for example you go somewhere, and when you come back you just have this unending feeling of dread about whether you’ll lose your interest in something? I went on a boat ride with some family members of mine yesterday for my brother’s birthday and when I got back home I had this feeling, thinking that I would lose my interest in the things that I love.

pvskm8,I'm going to therapy...,"I have been self-diagnosed with anxiety for about 2 years now, but i only realized that i have anxiety, like, a year ago. I'm 100% sure i have anxiety. As soon as i step out of my house i become self conscious, i start shaking, i walk weirdly, my heart starts pounding heavily, etc... 

My parents realized yesterday that i was shaking while we were at the mall. Today, my mom started talking about it with me and she told me that I'm probably gonna go to therapy soon. I don't really mind that because it's for the best, but the problem is, i know the biggest reason for my anxiety and nobody else does... And that is, i was being bullied in middle school (I'm in highschool rn). This is the biggest reason why i haven't told my parents about my anxiety before, because i never told them i was being bullied. The reason i didn't tell them is because i feared that they would judge me, and yell at me for not doing anything to stand up for myself, in fact my self-confidence was so bad that i was hanging out with my bullies. I realized later that i made a big mistake because i haven't told my parents since day one that i was being bullied and if i told them now they would be much more mad at me. While my mom and i were talking today, she asked me if i was bullied in school and i lied... I can't even tell my brother the truth, and he is the the only person i don't feel anxious around.

I fear that when i start going to therapy, my therapist would most likely ask what's the reason for my anxiety, and i really don't wanna lie, but if i say it's because of bullying he will most likely tell my parents, and i can't even imagine how mad they would be at me for not telling them before. 

I don't know what to do. I can say that i was always shy and that my self-confidence was always bad (which i also true) but now it turned into anxiety, or i can say the truth and endure my parents yelling at me. I know what's the right thing to do but i don't think i have enough confidence to tell the truth.",2021-09-26 17:36:44

pvrmwt,I cancel plans often,"I always try to at least give myself a buffer like, “I’ll try to make it” or “I’ll do my best to be there”. I highly recommend using phrases like this (especially if you’re being genuine!) because it doesn’t tie you to a definite YES but you express that you’re interested and will actually try your best. Before covid, I feel like I went to things 90% of the time. Like why not? I would give myself a time limit and most of the time, my extroverted self would come out. I’d feel tired and depleted afterward but that’s fine.  For context, I live on the fringe of a major city but within an hour on public transportation. This alone is stressful AF to deal with - before and after covid. But I’d do it in most cases.

Lately, I’m not sure if it’s increased social anxiety due to not seeing my friends in person for so long or if I’m just more hyper aware of the lengths it takes me to get to places, but I’ve turned into a flanker. Or at least that’s what my brain is telling me I am. Sometimes you have to commit to things and set a time/place. Lately, I’ll cancel before it even gets there or cancel the morning of and give an excuse. 

Does anyone else do this? Part of it for me is that I also just don’t want to travel an hour in a city riddled with covid cases but it seems like I’m always expected to. Maybe I need to start planning things near me and asking anyone who wants to see me needs to put my comfort first, and not the convenience of meeting right near their house/in their neighborhood.",2021-09-26 16:25:24

pvqqo8,Anxiety progress !,"M/26. Generalised anxiety disorder/panic disorder/medicated/7.5years

So yesterday night I was chillin, watchin movies with the boys, and movies give me pretty bad anxiety. So I was feeling really anxious. Like 7/10 and I didn’t really want to say how bad it was to the boys so I just dealt with it. But after the movies were done I needed to chill myself out and jump back in to reality. Which is usually easier said than done in my experience. I’ve read books and gone to therapy, I know a few techniques that help. Normally for me, posting on Reddit really helps but it kinda feels weird, Yknow? Like I’m being annoying for writing my thoughts and problems and posting it to the public. So anyways instead of doing that I pulled out an old note book and pen and I wrote my anxiety a letter. Sounds kinda weird but it worked. In the letter I basically told my anxiety that it’s an asshole and I’m not going to let it ruin my life. I also wrote about why I’m feeling anxious and that even though I’m struggling almost everyday I’m still not giving up no matter what. I have problems but I’m working on them. And I know that I’ll always be fine regardless of my anxiety and how shitty I feel at the time. After finishing the letter I instantly felt better. Facing my negativity and gaining control of my mind through a pen and paper worked great for me. I since then bought a journal and will continue documenting my progress and confronting my anxiety this way. I strongly recommend anyone try it. One thing I know for sure about anxiety is that words = power. Anyways that’s my rant and my advice. Hope it works for you like it did for me.

pvqme1,Start my new job tomorrow and I'm bricking it,"Lost my last job just before Christmas and spent the time since searching. I've finally landed an apprenticeship in an office role which I've never worked in before (I used to work in education) and I'm incredibly anxious. 

Last few days I've felt it creeping in, standard worries of what if I'm bad at the job, what if I don't get on with my co-workers and with unemployment/pandemic I also just haven't interacted with people a whole much so it's getting back in the swing of things. 

In the same vein there is also excitement of the potential to find a role I thrive in, make some new friends and generally get into a healthy routine of actually doing things beyond endlessly applying for jobs. 

I am bricking it, I am anxious but got to go into this head on. Most of the fears are and will be purely fabricated by my own mind so it's about kicking them to the curb. Having said that if any of you want to send good vibes my way I'd appreciate that too!

Whenever I  fall asleep my body wants to go full hypnagogic and do an ""astral  travel"" I am not really into esoteric, but lets call it Astral Travel. I  get the mini brain zaps, cold shivering, my body feels lighter and  colder. I then get the vibration feeling like I am vibrating completely.  If I try to let it, I just shake and convulse. I have to try and try  and try to fall asleep. At first I was so scared that I couldn't sleep  and the less I slept the more I thought that I was going insane. I  finally had an appointment with my GP and he prescribed seroquel and  said we would taper off Vortioxetine, however now seroquel makes my  whole body shake like crazy and this gives me even more anxiety.

pvq5r8,Forming anxious attachments to people who aren't interested in me,"I wasn't sure where to post this. I guess it's a relationships issue, and I do have OCD but I feel like this relates more to my anxiety. 


Pretty much all my life I've had a cycle of becoming interested in someone romantically, and then my emotional wellbeing depends purely on the response I get from them.

My current situation is that I've met someone online (I play online video games and so tend to meet friends that way regularly) but this particular person I've taken a fondness to.

We have been playing together pretty much every night for the last 2 months and when we're done we'll spend an hour sometimes more just talking about general stuff. He suggested we swap numbers so we could send eachother pics of stuff we were talking about (food and stuff like that) so we did. We only talk as friends and he rarely ever messages me unless we're talking about a specific thing.

Despite the fact that he seems uninterested in me, I still feel so sad and anxious during the day and then get the highest of highs if he does reach out to me. I just feel like I'm never happy just in my own company, doing my own thing. I'm always relying on these people to throw me scraps.

I feel so frustrated that I'm like this. Why do I even care about someone who shows no interest in me? I was laying in bed last night and the rational part of my brain was saying 'this person who you've never met shouldn't dictate your happiness like this'. But I just can't stop feeling this way. I feel so silly and embarrassed to be honest. I'm 31.

pvq4zt,Feeling dizzy is an anxiety symptom?,"This weekend I was out with family and friends when all of a sudden I started to feel quite dizzy. So I took myself outside to get some fresh air and have a moment to myself.

Unfortunately a few people followed me, with best intentions they tried to make sure I was okay. I obviously appreciate it but it just made me feel a whole lot worse. As in my mind, I felt some pressure to ""shake it off"" and I knew I just couldn't and I imagined myself getting worse and worse, even creating a ""scene"". 
Once I realized I was able to head home from that situation, I naturally started to feel a bit better. 
But through their comforting at the time, some of them suggested that I may have something like diabetes (!) and to go get tested. Whilst true and something that I should get tested, it's not what I needed to hear at that moment. 
Being a bit of a hypochondriac, it's plagued me all weekend that I might have to action these tests and I've not felt right since!

This morning, I received a message from my boss, just a casual chat about the week, it's fine and normal. But afterwards it instantly triggered another dizzy episode, the room was spinning. But despite all that I've mentioned, I'm quite good at rationalizing with myself. Because I could quite clearly see the trigger, I could quickly dissipate the dizziness.

I suppose the pressure to ""feel better"" to be able to make it to work, triggered the dizzy spell? The pressure to ""feel better"" during the first episode, made me worse. The pressure to look after my family (I am my wife's carer and we have a young child), is just always there, I don't really get a chance to rest. I mean, that not true, I get lots of free time. But it seems I have these dizzy spells at the worst time, such as both my wife and child need assistance at the same time! I don't want to let them down but sometimes I just need to sit down and gather myself, sometimes I can't and it makes me feel worse. 

Sorry, I'm new here, apologies if it's bad etiquette. I just needed to get this written down.

Hopefully someone can relate and let me know how they handle, especially feeling dizzy symptoms?",2021-09-26 14:24:35

pvpjod,"I thought I was getting better at dealing with anxiety, but now it’s completely out of control.","I’ve been dealing with anxiety all my life. I had to learn how to train myself on going through with the discomfort and pain anxiety caused me in order to be able to do things normal people do: going to school, going to university, taking exams, driving, meeting new people, anything new really. 

I learned, for a while, that feeling sick in relation to something new I was about to do, was “normal” for me, but something I had to overcome if I wanted to achieve something in life. 

I managed to move to another country, find a job, and making friends all on my own. For a while it seemed like I was getting really good at this “living a normal life” thing. 

Until the pandemic hit. It started with me being terrified of losing my job, then my sister instead lost her job (she lives in the same country as me) and so I was worrying about her. Then worrying about my parents getting sick, and my sisters getting sick. 

It got to a point where, when nothing was wrong with me and I shouldn’t had to worry about anything, I worried about other people, losing sleep even. 

And if I don’t worry about other people, then I start worrying about literally anything, even things I know makes no sense, like one night I couldn’t sleep because I was thinking that I didn’t want to die and be reincarnated in someone that lived in a super poor, war stricken country. 

How absurd is that?? 

And now anxiety has recently stopped me from accepting a job offer for a job in my field, that I’ve been pursuing for almost a year. The idea of changing job (even tho I wanted to!), starting from scratch and doing something new, the idea of being an impostor and being super under qualified, made me feel so sick that I couldn’t eat and sleep for 2 days. In the end,just to make the feeling stop, I chose to turn down the offer.

And now I’m beating myself over it because “what if I never get another opportunity “? 

I don’t know, I’m just tired of feeling like this and having people judging me because they think I’m lazy, when in reality I would love to do so many things but it’s just so painful!",2021-09-26 13:34:38

TW,I’m able to track back some of this but not all so I’m not sure where it’s true origin came from yet. I remember developing the skill at least as far back as high school when teachers would ask me 20 questions just so I could go work on something else in my free period. I garnish my reasoning of why I need to leave to make them less likely to say no. I grew up with a not great step dad and a mom who didn’t stick up for me so I would tell not total truths and answer bare minimum questions just to avoid the wrath of being berated/talked down to instead of being offered help. So now it’s turned into whenever a family member asks where I’m going and I’m going to see someone they don’t know or wanna do something without having to hear what they think I just say I’m with someone they know to avoid all the question surrounding who the new person is. Or if I want to go camping with a friend I don’t feel like being told all the reasons why it’s not a good idea. I just don’t like giving anyone 24/7 access to everything I’m doing and I don’t want to get wrapped up in meaningless conversations so I tell small lies even when I don’t need to I still do it because that’s how deep the habit is rooted.,2021-09-26 13:34:30

pvoxiy,Is what im feeling normal or is it actual anxiety? And should I talk to my doctor about it?,"Through out middleschool and highschool, I hated public speaking or having to present because I would get extremely nervous and get common physical symptoms such as rapid heart rate, upset stomach, sweating, etc. It would get so bad, that I would miss school to avoid doing it. If I couldn’t avoid it, I would stutter, turn bright red, and my head would go blank during presentions. Ice breakers/introductions where also anxiety inducing. For a while, I believed I had a mild form of social anxiety but I brushed it off because I dont like the idea of self diagnosing, and just told myself that these are normal feelings everyone goes through. 

Now im a sophomore in college, these feelings still follow me during social situations. However, I’ve been feeling very anxious for a different reason. Im so stressed out about my grades and so worried about the future, that it prevents me from living in the present.

pvod59,No wonder I’m feeling off,"In the past three months I have:

- switched directly from Paxil to Lexapro (went badly)
- went back to Paxil and added Abilify (tried it for two weeks and hated it)
- went back to just Paxil and added 1 mg of Ativan daily (though you’re not supposed to take it daily)
- tried testosterone injections (my testosterone is off-the-charts low for a 49yo)
- cross-tapered from Paxil to Lexapro (3 weeks now)
- added Ambien for sleep 
- stopped the testosterone because I felt like it was too many variables

So now I’m down to 10 mg Lexapro (3 weeks in), Ambien and 1 mg of Ativan. 

I’ve been feeling major physical anxiety, mood swings and zero motivation.  I think a lot of this has to do with still ramping up on the Lexapro and likely being “hooked” on the Ativan and getting “rebound anxiety”. It’s probably also not smart to be on Ambien too. 

So, I think I am going to try to taper off the Ativan and Ambien. I’m worried it will be really hard because I’m in a very stressful part of my job but I think I need to do this. Wish me luck and feel free to send advice.",2021-09-26 11:58:47

pvntzm,How do I talk to women?,"(This is also a bit of a vent, but I think it helps paint the picture of my problems)

Backstory as to why I have this problem in the first place. When I was 15 I got my first girlfriend (which compared to my friends, I was pretty late in the game). The whole thing lasted two months. The reason we broke up? 

She was using me to get closer to one of my friends. 

Now, I understand that 15 is pretty young, and some might even role their eyes at the fact of “this 15 year old got his heart broken boo hoo”. I get that, but that’s bullshit, cuz that fucking HURT. It really fucked with my mind, started making me wonder 

“Does this mean I’m not good enough?” 

“Do people just not want to date me?” 

“Jesus Christ, what’s wrong with me?”, 

Shit like that. Also I’ve been hinted at several times that I’m ugly. Or at the very least not the most good looking person in the bunch. So that’s also fucked with me mentally. 

Anyways, fast forward. I’m in college, and I haven’t dated since I was 15. There are a ton of beautiful looking women all around. And the only problem is I can’t build up the courage to talk to them. Every time I see a girl I’d at least like to try and start a conversation with, I just can’t bring myself to do it. Also I feel I should mention I’ve never had a girl once try something like that with me. I’ve seen it happen to my friend/dormmate several time throughout the years. And it’s already happened a couple of times since college started, so I know I’m not crazy thinking that a girl not even giving me the time of day isn’t normal. 

So what should I do? How do I talk to women?",2021-09-26 11:17:01

pvnpur,Anxiety Ridden for 17 years.,"Just here to complain. My anxiety, depression, and manic bipolar have pushed everyone I love away. I have tried getting a doctor for treatment but I've been unmedicated my entire life. I even stopped going to doctors the day I turned 18. I just got insurance for the first time and the first doctor my insurance assigned me was out of practice. So I had my insurance transfer me to another office. The second one wasn't even accepting new patients and didn't tell us until I was trying to schedule appointments with them.. The third doctor was booked out 8 months. And now the fourth doctor is not returning my voice mails I keep leaving them.. I've left 6 in about 3 months. I have severe and debilitating anxiety attacks every single day. They almost always start with tension in my chest  then my nose starts to close up and my hands begin to feel numb. I get a headache usually in my eyes. I start to feel weird, kind of airy, then I get cold sweats. My heart starts to race and pound. It gets hard to breathe. Then my heart rate drops. Good second or longer in-between heart beats. My hearing goes away and I start feeling super cold and I shiver. I feel like I'm going to die. I'm home alone tonight and I have Covid. No one cares. I can barely breath from Covid and it triggers my anxiety attacks. I've had 3 today and I feel another onsetting. I'm only 27 years old and I hate feeling like I'm going to die.

pvmyn4,"Can’t eat even when I’m hungry, struggling to sleep","Hello. I’m a 30F, and I’ve had some mild anxiety (mostly health anxiety) throughout my life that was mostly manageable. I did have some pretty rough periods about 10 years ago, but not really comparable to what I’ve been going through lately.

Basically, I’m in a psych ward rn because after a bad reaction to antibiotics, I ended up with nightly nocturnal panic attacks that left me very sleep deprived and extremely sick over 18 nights in a row.

Since being here, they’ve been giving me a little lorazepam (Ativan), which helped initially (it’s been 2.5 weeks now) but I’m still having break-through anxiety (current dose is 0.25mg in the morning and 0.5mg approx 6:30pm) and sleep is getting challenging again. I’m also PMSIng now so that might be making things worse.

I’m getting concerned because I keep losing my appetite and eating becomes incredibly hard, constant nausea or just feeling overwhelmed when I try to eat. I’m losing weight kinda fast and I wasn’t that big to begin with. I’ve been awake now since 5:30am trembling a little and trying to fully accept the anxious sensations without judgement but I also feel so hungry and don’t know what to do. :( 

I’m trying to be strong but this is getting so exhausting. 8 weeks ago I loved sleeping and loved eating, and it’s still difficult for me to comprehend how I’ve deteriorated so rapidly.

pvmlf3,Anxiety/some kind of issue with my ears?,"I have GAD, and I'm not sure if it's related to this situation. Essentially, I have some sort of problem with the backs and tops of my ears (externally, not the inside of my ears). I've been noticing it since COVID started, when masks would irritate my ears, but I think it's been an issue for a long time. Just wearing my glasses can make me uncomfortable, especially with my hair. I'm constantly taking my glasses off and putting them back on- I don't like to have any hair under the glasses, not even my baby hairs/short hairs underneath that inevitably end up under an arm of my glasses. Obviously, not wearing my glasses isn't really an option, although I do try to give myself frequent breaks throughout the day. 
I can't really describe how it feels when my glasses are in an uncomfortable position. Overwhelming, uncomfortable, but if I focus on it it's not physically irritating, so I don't think it's some kind of skin issue. It's not even that I feel anxious, I just feel like it's wrong and I need to fix my glasses and hair. It hasn't cause any huge problems, like I haven't had any anxiety/panic attacks about it, but it's a constant annoyance that just keeps getting worse. It's especially bad now because my touching all around the sides of my ears has given me a couple pimples, so it hurts every time I go to adjust. 
I'm also wondering if it might be a sensory processing issue, but I don't know much about that.

pvmg1t,Need reassurance on anxiety pain and a bit of a vent,"My anxiety has been very bad for the last 9 days. A change in my living situation puts me living with my primary trigger and unfortunately it's not going to change anytime soon. I've had a number of panic attacks and on Tuesday went to the ER even though I was sure it was just a panic attack because I hadn't been able to calm down in 2 days.

I am feeling a bit better now but still experiencing generally high anxiety levels that I can't get down for more than a couple hours. With that I have pain across my chest, my arm, in my shoulder and side and over my lower ribs. It's intermittent and gets worse as the anxiety gets worse. It's probably just the muscles responding to being so tense for so long.
The doctors said there was no emergency and this has been my third anxiety related ER trip this year. The first was when I learned I had it. The pain though is feeding the anxiety in a loop and I don't know how to deal with it. It's just constant. 

My doctor has me on Wellbutrin, it has helped until this recent episode, and the benzo he has me supplement with dosent help with the physical effects I think. It just makes me tired and only sometimes. 
My friends have been able to distract me enough to help when it's an attack but I can't keep relying on them and I don't know what to do about the day to day. 

I have been doing the breathing exercises my therapist told me to do. They help some.

I was originally thinking of teaching high school or middle school but based on the anxiety I felt I’m not sure I’m cut out for teaching in general, I don’t feel this type of anxiety when I’m walking around college and even around my classmates, I just feel like the high school crowd can be super harsh and judgemental and maybe that’s why I felt so much anxiety?

The thought of parent teacher conferences and interacting with parents in general also gives me anxiety, I used to work in a dental office and some parents were really judgemental/entitled (not saying all parents are like this, most were really nice but there were some that were really rude)

i had a pretty good time, like everything seemingly went smoothly, but i can’t let go of the fact that something just didn’t feel right about it. i felt like i always said the wrong thing, or that every time i opened my mouth i was complaining and needed to be reassured and that i was being annoying and pessimistic. or that i wasn’t friendly enough because i was so in my head and anxious and now people think i hate them. 

for example, i have a friend i really like and we talk all the time but suddenly it was so much harder in a group dynamic and i feel like i wasn’t being as good of a friend to them as i usually try to be. and i couldn’t tell if they wanted to be around me or not and i just felt like i wasn’t being entertaining or compassionate enough or something. so i didn’t even talk to them as much as i really wanted to because i didn’t want to bother them with my presence but i also feel like maybe they feel bad or like i was avoiding them? but i have no idea how to tell the difference with body language. 

like, i keep forgetting how hard and draining it all is. i literally feel so empty inside now and like such a burden and so undesirable in so many ways. and nothing bad even really happened. i even made new friends and everyone i met likes me (seemingly). but i just can’t shake the feeling that i fucked it all up and that the world would be better off without me around. i literally don’t know why but large group activities make me borderline suicidal afterwards for a few days and i can’t figure out why. i don’t even feel like a person i just feel like a shell that does whatever i can to make sure people like me and still somehow messes it up. i feel like a dumb little alien that is trying to copy how everyone is socializing. i just want it to be easy. i wish i could just be myself. i hate it.",2021-09-26 09:06:58

Now that I feel better about my body, my social anxiety happens to be getting even worse unfortunately. I’ve been recommended Zoloft but I am TERRIFIED of gaining weight. I really don’t want to. I know antidepressants make you drowsy and lower energy. So I need to know this information before I start taking Zoloft.",2021-09-26 08:04:34
pvkrdd,Going to ask my doctor to get back on Paxil. I’m so scared and feel so defeated.,"This next big chunk of text is me venting about my anxiety so feel free to gloss over this lol

I got prescribed Paxil when I was 15 and stayed on it for 6 years. I decided to taper off last summer because I felt like I was fine, knew how to cope, and knew the anxiety I used to feel was just me overreacting at things. I was so rational, motivated, and normal on Paxil. I knew what I wanted to do in my future, had hobbies, good grades, worked two jobs, interned, and volunteered. 

Well fast forward to me tapering of in spring 2020, I was officially done with the med august 2020… then covid got worse and my boyfriend got sick. Queue my anxiety getting heightened. I was scared for my diabetic dad. Then February came and I switched my major just as I got accepted into a university after spending 4 years at community college. I was so lost with my future.  
In June I knew I needed help and was feeling suicidal from the anxiety. I couldn’t handle it. I called the crisis line like 5 times in a month. I convinced myself I had cancer and was going into a spiral everyday. I finally started seeing a therapist late June. She’s great, but I still feel impending doom. 
Whenever I drive, I convince myself I’m going to die. Whenever I have a stomach ache, I convince myself I’m going to have diarrhea in public (anxiety gave me very bad IBS) and because of this I pop pepto bismol and Imodium like candy ruining my natural digestive process. I also have a chronic bladder problem where I have to pee like 20 times a day and constantly feel like I have a UTI and I’m going to pee myself in public. It’s ruined traveling, Disneyland, and driving long distances for me. But I feel like anxiety made this problem worse, as my bladder was fine when I was on Paxil.I have a fear of eating and have convinced myself food is going to make me sick. So I regularly just live off of toast or pasta with vegan butter and salt. 
Anxiety is creating a lot of fears for me I need to stop in it’s tracks (like driving, going to concerts, theme parks, traveling) I am genuinely considering selling my Hamilton tickets I was so excited for because of my anxiety about my IBS and bladder. 
~end of anxiety life story~

I’m just so scared to go back on Paxil. I was still me on the drug. I just was more calm and collected. The only bad thing was getting off of it. That was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. 
I’m also scared how it will affect my relationship with my boyfriend and I. I read something that said SSRIs make people fall out of love?? What??? Granted, I don’t think this will happen as my boyfriend and I met when I was on Paxil. I continued to be on it for a year, I tapered off of it with his support. Plus I love him more than anything lol. I feel so guilty sometimes the way I treat him because of my anxiety. I get so irritable because I’m anxious and I constantly need his support. I question that he loves me and will never leave me. It must be so exhausting for him. 

I just feel defeated. I was only able to last a year off of the drug and here I am crawling back begging to be medicated. But I can almost see the future of my ibs, bladder illness, agoraphobia, health anxiety, and fear of driving (I can’t be scared of driving, I live in Southern California!!) consuming me if I don’t put a stop to this soon enough. I’m only 23 I have so much left in life

Wondering if anyone has experience with this, sorry for the long write up, I don’t see my therapist until Monday and needed to vent now :D",2021-09-26 07:46:51
pvkpjk,How can I overcome my anxiety so I don’t screw up with this girl?,"16 year old boy here. A few weeks ago this girl made it clear that she’s interested in me and gave me her number. She’s pretty cute and is fun to be around so I could really see myself growing to like her a lot. But one huge problem I have is that I never know how to start good convos. I always overthink what I’m going to say and become too anxious to even attempt to start one so I almost never end up talking to her, but she still makes it clear that she has interest in me. I’m really worried that I’ll brood over what to say for too long and she’ll end up losing interest in me. How can I overcome this?",2021-09-26 07:43:52

Childhood was okay I guess but I can’t even remember the happy memories from back then because my mind is so Fkn far gone I can’t think clearly my memory is non existent. All I have are regrets.

I don't really know anyone here and I don't start my new job for a few more weeks. All the change and the loneliness has caused my depression and anxiety to return with a vengeance and I'm feeling overwhelmed. Because I'm in a different state and now have different insurance, I will have to find a new psychiatrist and therapist after working with the same people for about 5 years. I'm struggling because as you'd probably expect, at a time when I need these resources more than usual, it's been harder to really get anything done including looking up psychiatrists/therapists and figuring out insurance. I know that it will eventually get better, as it has before, but that doesn't seem to make the present any less difficult.

pvhjrw,THE ANXIETY PARADOX (how to recover from anxiety and panic disorder),"If you suffer from any kind of anxiety, you're probably all too familiar with the ""fear of the fear"". You know how anxiety and panic are the worst feelings in the world. It's very hard to put into words how helpless it makes you feel whenever you're in the middle of a panic attack, worried it might never end. I suffered from anxiety and panic disorder for more than 4 years myself.

Exactly *because* it feels so fucking horrific, it shouldn't come as a surprise that for nearly all sufferers, *eliminating their anxiety* is their biggest wish. It definitely was for me. It is, however, this fixation on eliminating anxiety, that paradoxically keeps reinforcing your anxiety. It's like a feedback loop from hell.

I'm not a scientist, but I've definitely done my fair share of research. Anxiety is regulated in the amygdala. It's supposed to protect you from enemies, animals, dangerous situations, etc. Your amygdala, however, doesn't really function based on rational or logic. It functions based on actions, reactions and behavioral feedback. If a certain event causes you a great deal of stress or pain, your amygdala ""learns"" that that is a danger. It will then try to prevent you from said danger by sending you signals (feelings of anxiety) whenever your amygdala recognizes a potential trigger.

So how does this correspond to my claim that the recovery of anxiety is a paradox? Well, let me try to explain: Panic attacks and very strong feelings of anxiety can be absolutely debilitating. You reacted to this by fighting these feelings, trying to avoid triggers, etc etc etc. This has TAUGHT your amygdala that the feeling of anxiety in itself is something dangerous that needs to be avoided! This is a terrible thing because it makes us scared of the anxiety itself. It can turn a slight feeling of anxiety into a full-blown panic attack! Your amygdala will recognize a potential trigger, for example, a bodily sensation that you feel during anxiety or panic, and it will send you more signals to try to warn you of the anxiety! (*Oh no, I'm feeling anxious! I can feel my heart beating fast again! I can feel my stomach feeling weird.. Oh no, I'm going to have a panic attack again! I'm back to square one! All my progress has gone down the drain!)*

This can make recovery from anxiety nearly impossible. Fixating on getting rid of the anxiety is a behavior that reinforces the belief of your amygdala that anxiety is bad. It will also keep your amygdala firing signals any time you might feel a little anxious. Recovery from anxiety is **not** possible as long as we are ***anxious*** *of anxiety.*

So, how do we turn this around? Its quite easy actually. Its called doing nothing. Like I said before, the amygdala functions based on actions, reactions and **behavioral feedback.** This works the other way around too. We can literally *unlearn* our brain to respond to specific triggers, and even make it less sensitive in general. We do this by practicing acceptance. Acceptence is, in my opinion, the only true cure to anxiety. What I mean by acceptance is not fighting the anxiety. Not fighting the feelings. Not trying to get rid of whatever you're feeling in the moment, not trying to avoid, not trying to escape, not trying to distract yourself. Instead, accept. Sit with it. Float through it. Not reacting to signals from your amygdala is a beautiful thing. It teaches your brain that there is no danger! We need to teach our brain not to fear the feeling of anxiety, for that is a completely natural feeling! We need anxiety! Okay, you're right, we don't need it as much as you are feeling it right now! But still, the feeling of anxiety is not something we need to fear in itself.

This is not something that will fix you in an hour or a day. But keep practicing it. Keep sitting with the feelings of anxiety, and you will feel them subside. Don't try to convince yourself you will be okay, for that is ALSO a reaction to amygdala, and like I said before, feedback and reactions will only reestablish that it is a genuine danger, and that your brain is right in sending you these signals! Float through the anxiety. Instead of seeing those moments of anxiety and panic as obstacles, start to see them as opportunities to train yourself! Try to place your worst enemy in a positive perspective, and you will see how fast your perception changes. Everytime you get a panic attack, that’s an opportunity to teach your brain to be less anxious! Those moments of pain are the only moments where true change happens. It is definitely one of the hardest things you can do. Sadly, the only way past anxiety is to go right THROUGH it. You need to completely submerge yourself in it, and, the hardest part, not fight it. You need to look for the anxiety, even invite it from time to time. Make it your friend.

The good news is, that going through this will eventually give you a mental toughness that very few people will ever have. You will be so much stronger than anyone else you know. It just takes a lot of courage to start the progress, but I’m sure you can do it .

It started out with not being able watch my favourite football team (soccer) but had now stretched to any sport where a Brit may be participating, whether I have a real love for the sport or not. 


This has meant missing Emma Radacanus win in the US Open, Lewis Hamilton in the F1, England in the Rugby, and cumulated with Joshua loss to Usyk, where I had to dig ridiculously deep to finish listening to the 12 rounds and now feel so depressed.

pvgre9,Work and the future,"Work and the future are a big source of anxiety for me. I’m 26 now and I feel so worthless most of the time, though all the people I connect and see in life, think the opposite of me, like I’m intelligent and “good”.

I was always a perfectionist and started  to study engineering a few years back, but it was to much for me back then and the stress.

Right now I’m doing another apprenticeship, and maybe want to go back to study next year or the year after.

But I feel so much behind in life.
I need to do an internship and just calling or applying is such a huge source of stress and anxiety for me, just a huge problem. So I suppress.
I just wish, I would improve and some day, be “normal”. But right when I think I improved, everything seems to get worse again.

I know this is life on hard mode, as I read here :)
But what can I do, should I speak with a therapist again, looking if I maybe have AvPD or social anxiety …
I just want to be better with things work and social related, so I can handle studies, work and love a good life.",2021-09-26 03:43:43

pvgfw5,It gets better!,"Hi! So around may (when i hit rock bottom) my anxiety was extremely bad. Like so bad I was terrified to leave my room. I had stopped going to school, was over eating constantly and was also depressed. In early june my mother had decided to admit me into inpatient, but I ended up going to outpatient lol. (3 times a week for three hours each appointment.) So I did that and worked very very hard. I switched my meds over the summer and started going on walks outside. Today (September 25th) I have now been able to go back to school, go to a restaurant (been twice!) drive myself to the library and also drive to therapy by myself. I’ve been doing so well I have actually, since Thursday, graduated from outpatient and am now seeing a regulars therapist once a week. My conclusion is, it does get better! I’m only 16, but through hard work and determination I was able to start pulling my life together, and you can too. It’s not always easy, but it’s worth it.",2021-09-26 03:25:19

Well, I’ve finally hit the bullet and have an appointment to begin the modified adult vaccination schedule. And I’m super anxious about it. It’ll be in about 1.5 weeks.

The only vaccine I’ve had is the COVID vaccine (signed up the day I became eligible), and didn’t have too bad a reaction (worst in the household, but all normal). I did have multiple anxiety attacks surrounding them, though.

pvfo2k,Doubtful about taking Alprazolam for my anxiety/panic attacks.,"I need some help, advises from people that actually used xanax as a medical treatment for anxiety and panic attacks / and major fear of throwing up in public, and not for recreational usage. (Sorry for my english not my main language)

&#x200B;

So  trying to keep the story short and focus on the issue, I have a mild level of agoraphobia which usually starts when I go out, after few hours Im mostly alright with barely any anxiety/panic attacks but the first hours outside its really bad, with panic attacks, breathing, the sensation of the heart pounding and the worst feeling that is nauseas and sometimes when its really bad throwing up.

I went to a psychiatrist which I dont feel he was quite professional it was a 10 min appointment in which he reccomended me to take

Vortioxetine 15mg one before a meal

Alprazolam 1/2 mg 3 times a day.

When I read the diagnose I felt it was really strong for my case. Im depressed but I do not believe I have a major depressión, on the other hand my panic attacks I understand needing some sort of pills for that but not sure if thats a good start, 3 times a day.

&#x200B;

Anyway I contacted another doctor which he reccomended starting on alprazolam 1/2 mg one  before going to sleep  (Im really curious if anybody knows that taking one alprazolam before going to sleep helps the anxiety of the next day when going out?) and having one pill on my backpack anywhere I go just in case, and leaving aside the anttidepressant until I start therapy and see how major is my depression.

Any answers with some personal experience or medical experience will truly help me out making a choice about this, Im rather desperate and I need to make a choice soon.

&#x200B;

I do want to start the alprazolam choice using the option of one before going to sleep to help next day anxiety going out, but Im a bit scared about the addiction and side effects of it.",2021-09-26 02:41:37

I have started drinking 20-30mg CBD coffee and that has seemed to really help. I’m still learning about this, but would it be better to buy the oil itself and put it in food, drinks, etc?

I’m likely to end up being on medication once I’m able to see a psychiatrist (recommended by my therapist), but I would love to go organic before diving into medication (done it before but related to anti-depressants and didnt like the side effects).",2021-09-26 02:23:08
pvf9li,Is there any way to stop this?,"Yeah. Anxiety. It's ruining my life. So here's the deal; I got an offer to go on a little vacation for free for a few days. (Going out of state to spend a few days with my boyfriend and his family) And I get to decide when I want to do this. All I have to do is say the word. Now anyone would probably love an opportunity like that, but my anxiety prevents me from being excited/happy about this.

I really do want to go badly, but guess what? My anxiety causes physical problems, so bad to the point I shut down and cannot even communicate for the life of me. Yep, you read right. I literally mentally shut down like a robot. Then I can't stop shaking, feeling like I'll hurl, get diarrhea, stomach pain. Ugh, my stomach just goes crazy. And it's like that the ENTIRE trip. I get no break. I end up having the worst time of my life. I'm even sick just thinking about this vacation. 

It does it no matter what I do... I can go to the grocery store or talk on the phone/video chat and get sick from the anxiety of it. I was so excited to finally get to go the beach this summer and I ended getting sick on the beach from the anxiety... and the main problem is the diarrhea. And it just causes MORE anxiety. 

It's been like this since I was a little kid, but recently it got worse. It used to be I just FELT like I had to go to the bathroom, but now I actually get diarrhea and feel like absolute garbage during and for days after the trip.

And I already have stomach problems all the time... but the stomach issues is making my anxiety much worse... and vice versa. 

I just don't know what to do anymore... I want to do things, go on vacations, or even just do something as simple as going to a store without getting sick af... I'm fed up. And I don't even know where to begin to help/stop this? PLEASE. PLEASE. If anyone has gone through this and has an effective way to help, PLEASE share! I want to take back control of my life and not constantly live in a state of fear and anxiety. 



(I also do not know the cause of it... I'm not even scared of people? My thoughts are not even running wild, I just get physically sick from it? It's weird. It's like subconscious anxiety. Even if I don't think about it.)

pvf2cn,Anxiety advice,"I’ve had bad anxiety from being a small kid. Like random panic attacks in public, troubles in school because I didn’t know how to act around people or if they felt the same way. Over the years, I’ve learned to control my anxiety in different ways and dealt with the fact that it will probably never leave me fully. 

The last year has been great. I got rid of people who caused me stress, making my anxiety 100x worse, I started a degree, I’ve met someone. But it just comes trickling back like it sees you’re happy and needs to destroy that. Over the past few weeks, I’ve felt my self slipping and had the occasional bad day here in there. But tonight I’ve had a full blown, manic, breathless panic attack and I’m not sure where to go from here. 

I’m so stubborn to the fact that I need help and taking tablets etc will help me but I just feel like once you go down that road, you’re acknowledging that you’re not good and it’s acceptance.

pve6kl,Understanding Anxiety," *A truly good man does nothing,*

*Yet leaves nothing undone.*

**Lao Tzu**

&#x200B;

*Bojack Horseman* is a TV show about a self-destructive sitcom actor from the 90s.

On the day of his new movie premieres, he’s torn apart by anxiety. As he’s trying to relax in his jacuzzi, his friend Todd comes around.

“Hey buddy, big day?”

“No…” 

“Big premiere day?”

“Stop.”

“Secretariat in theaters now. How exciting?”

“Please stop.”

“People are seeing your movie, forming opinions, judging you all over the country.” 

“Why are you doing this?”

“Or no, maybe nobody is seeing it? Wouldn’t it be weird if nobody saw your movie?”

“How do I get out of this conversation?”

“By this time tomorrow we’ll know if it’s a hit or a flop. The air crackles with possibilities!” 

“Oh, good lord…”

Bojack slowly drowns himself in the tub…

This is a very familiar dialogue for people with anxiety and overthinking. Our b\*tch of an inner voice constantly pokes at our insecurities much like Todd’s, imaginatively escalating our worries beyond control.

Anxiety is always unsettling. It catches us off guard, and quickly surges into overwhelming sensations. If we let it, it’ll control and consume our lives.

Now, don’t confuse anxiety with fear. fear is real sh\*t. It’s a vital reaction in face of a threat. Fear keeps you alive in acute physical emergencies, by triggering the fight or flight response. When we’re afraid, our heart rate increases, our senses are enhanced. Colors become vivid. Everything happens in slow motion, yet occurs so fast like in a John Woo movie. 

Summoned in a healthy dose, fear will give you the swift edge you need in the short term and the dedicated motivation in the long run. It shows care and concern for those you love. It allows for judgement and resolution, accompanied by energy and focus.

### “Nothing… the silent killer…”

Problems arise when fear becomes a self-perpetuating condition rather than a coping function. Instead of either fight or flight, we then get paralysis. When feeling incapable of handling the situation, we become anxious. We even start dreading our anxiety… We get anxious about getting anxious. We worry about worrying.

The root cause of anxiety is the fear of losing control. Our health, jobs, relationships, status… Everything can slip in a moment. We can never know what the future will bring. 

So, we create stories in our minds to feel a sense of control over our lives. Because if we imagine scenarios in our heads, we feel in charge. Like a kid playing with Action-Man and Barbie figures… Except in our version of the story Action-Man suffers a divorce, Barbie gets unemployed, and both of them fail to pay their mortgage!

You see, we tend to exaggerate and catastrophize uncertainties. Every little doubt turns into a wildfire of escalating what ifs. Woody Alan once wrote, “I am plagued by doubts. What if everything is an illusion and nothing exists? In that case, I definitely overpaid for my carpets!”

These what ifs never relate to the present. They’re either about the past or the future, but they still somehow feel more real than the present. Mark Twain jokingly stated that “I’ve lived through some terrible things in my life, some of which actually happened.” So, ask yourself: 

· What is bothering you?

· Does it exist beyond your imagination?

· Will it really matter in 5 years? In 5 days? In 5 minutes?

There’s a scene in the TV show *Parks and Recreation* where obsessively hypochondriac Chris thinks he’s fatally sick. After getting some tests, he gravely shares the results with his friends.

“The test and blood work came back and the news is terrible. They found nothing.”

“Nothing?

“Nothing. The silent killer.”

Our brains are wired to constantly look out for negatives. They constantly compare our situation with alternative outcomes and then tune into the worst possible one. Erring on the safe side keeps us alive. As Guru Laghima from *The Legend of Korra* says, “Instinct is a lie, told by a fearful body, hoping to be wrong.” No caveman ever died because he thought a twig was a snake. But if you ignore a snake, thinking it’s a twig, good luck ever finding a prehistorical hospital!

So nature knowingly tricks us. 

As neuroscientist Hanson says, “The brain is like Velcro for negative experiences but Teflon for positive ones.”

It overestimates threats so we can take them seriously. It underestimates opportunities so we can get our butts off the couch. 

To a healthy degree, threats are a great motivator. If you’re terrified of performing your trombone concerto in front of an audience, chances are you’ll start working you’re as\* off! And if you realize there are only 5 weeks left, you will work even harder!

The problems start when this negativity bias gets exaggerated. Overloaded by possible negative outcomes, our brains get hyper stimulated. They start building up conspiracy theories about ourselves. As Alain de Botton says, “Happiness is generally impossible for longer than fifteen minutes.”

Imagine this. 

It’s a pleasant evening. You come home and start practicing on your trombone—loving the groove and enjoying every minute of your flow. All of a sudden, doubt creeps in out of nowhere.

“What if my trombone slide gets stuck in the middle of the concert?” 

Even better….

**“**What if my trombone slide gets stuck in the middle of the concert and the maestro kicks me out in front of everyone?”

Or even better…

**“**What if my trombone slide gets stuck in the middle of the concert and the maestro kicks me out in front of everyone and then I realize I forgot to wear pants?”

Oh boy! You realize how this logic plays out like a teenage nightmare. In this sense, imagination is our worst enemy. 

See, what we really have here is not fear. Fear is always about something immediate, something that is happening now. But anxiety is about what “may happen.” We create these narratives in our heads and then surrender our sanity to them. It is like finding ourselves in a horror movie… Except we write the scripts, we hate the guy playing the trombone and we absolutely make sure that he doesn’t live for long!

pvd9m8,I finally opened up to my boyfriend about my anxiety.,"I (22F) have been dating my boyfriend, 22M for about a year. I’ve told him before I used to have an anxiety disorder (social anxiety disorder) but have never really gone into true depth about how much that affected me and the leftover effects of it. 

For context, I had SAD as a child and a teenager. It was socially and mentally crippling for me. Constantly thinking people were judging me, struggling with my self esteem, bad physical anxiety. Etc etc. I didn’t get any help for it until I was 18/19. I went to a therapist and got CBT and it changed my life. 

I don’t qualify as fitting the DSM-5 diagnosis for SAD anymore because of therapy and working on myself. However, I still consider myself to be an anxious person. I still struggle with anxiety. And I still have to work on my self esteem. Years and years of formative experiences and emotions being wrecked by anxiety can do that to a person. 

My boyfriend and I never fight; we just get along well enough not to. The one thing he gets upset at me about is that he feels that I don’t make decisions enough in our relationship. It started out that he didn’t like that he had to choose the restaurants we would go to. So I started trying to choose the restaurants. I’m definitely doing better on that front. Then it developed into okay, I choose restaurants, but he wants me to choose activities to do as well. So I’m working on that. 

He doesn’t like that I don’t play my music in the car and we always listen to his. So now I’m trying to play my music more. 

He says he talks more than me and starts more conversations and that bothers him. I said, I’m a naturally more quiet person. We had a conversation about that. We had a conversation about how if me not making a specific decision bothers him/frustrates him, he needs to communicate with me and tell me instead of just acting mad at me and causing me to anxiously spiral about why he’s mad. 

It’s a very emotional and triggering topic for me because growing up, I was always “that quiet girl,” my mom was constantly telling me to be more assertive, and I feel like I’ve been criticized for similar things my whole life. 

Communicating about it with him made me cry because like I said, it is triggering. But I’m proud of myself for communicating. We talked about how he is going to need to work on having empathy for me in these situations instead of always getting frustrated, and how he needs to communicate more. I need to make more decisions and act without overthinking things. 

I don’t think my boyfriend is 100% right about everything he said regarding the conversation-he said I don’t come up with conversation topics which just isn’t true. He FEELS that way though, which makes it his truth and so I told him I will work on that. 

It was also hard for me because I feel like he isn’t very reassuring. In that situation, getting a big hug and him letting me know he cares about me and likes me regardless would have been what I needed. Instead, I was the one telling him how much I care about him. He shows me he cares about me so it’s not that he doesn’t, however, I’ve been trying to work up the courage to tell him I love him and these recent events make me scared to say it first. 

It is a little frustrating to me because it’s like I know I have things to still work on regarding the above mentioned issues, but it is annoying because I feel like he should be more understanding and less quick to get in a bad mood or upset about it. 

Any thoughts on going forward and strengthening my relationship?",2021-09-26 00:31:31

Any suggestions for dealing with this?,"Today, for example, I'm running a 3 hour D&D session for some friends here in a few hours. That's it--I have absolutely no other plans for the day. Despite that, I have this constant feeling of anxiety and dread hanging over me. I feel like I can't start something (say, get into a game or practice drawing) because I have this **thing** coming up. It doesn't matter how much I like doing the thing, or how I know it's going to be a good time.

This extends to pretty much anything that I schedule. I've tried timeblocking strategies before to add some structure to my free time (ie Drawing practice from 1pm-3pm, then gaming/chill time from 3-5pm, dinner, etc etc). Nope, instant anxiety and dread as long as there's still something 'scheduled' for later that day.

If you're also someone who deals with this, how do you work to mitigate it? I can't go through life just constantly feeling like garbage whenever I have something planned, hah.

That if I want to help him and want to make progress, I have to be less tense. Afterwards I tensed up more and now every damn time I interact with my dog I try to be as relaxed as possible but trying that I tense up even more.
And now I am in a spiral trying my best, tensing up, overthinking that ia am bad for him, then trying to do better to be the owner he deserves and so on.
So if anyone has tips dealing with a dog with anxiety while having anxiety yourself, I would be very glad for advice.",2021-09-25 23:48:05
pvcf0a,Taking a long time,"I’ve been in therapy on and off for about 10 years.  The most recent therapist is really good.  I find myself making progress in that I’m not so focused on the negative aspects of my life and am more solution focused.

I’m 32 and Gay and new to the area and I want to meet more gay people and have more friends.  My depression is holding me back from this as I don’t feel confident enough to do this.  I also don’t want to feel so stressed out about work.  I want to have a sex life and these meds make it difficult to do that so I want to eventually get off of them.

pvbht1,Paused breathing while falling asleep,"I'm trying to post this on different subs to get an opinion.  My wife hasn't been sleeping well lately due to our nightly nursing toddler, and has been particularly exhausted.  She isn't diagnosed with anxiety but I think she has some form of it. Sometimes when she's stressed or when she's worried about something she'll get nauseous and vomit and diarrhea.  Anyways our son was having a rough night last night and  wife was overtired and nauseous, and commented that whenever she tried going to sleep, her breathing would slow down or even pause and she'd wake up to catch up.  She wasn't waking up choking so she doesn't think its OSA.

My question is, has anyone ever had anxiety or panic where they had this issue when trying to sleep?  I've been looking to see if it's central sleep apnea or if it's part of some panic attack she may have had.  Last night was the first time this has happened to her (to our knowledge).",2021-09-25 22:59:58

Hello. I am a 15-years-old Introvert that also has social anxiety. So I have this one friend that is a good. Me and her have known each other for years now but have only started getting closer and started chatting alot (Keep in mind this entire story does not include anything that happened in real life it's only online). So slowly I started getting used to her because we chat alot so then my guard went down and I am not too much of an introvert with her. In chat. But at times I try to be friendly with her since she always makes me happy aswell. So usually when she sends me a picture of herself and asks what I think I try to support her and compliment her with compliments like You look cute, You have a nice smile and etc. But after doing that I always just get myself worried since I feel I am being too friendly which could be a problem since I don't want her to think I like her as anything other than just a really close friend since that's not my intention here. Also at times I could apologize for talking too much since I really enjoy talking to her but I wanna make sure I am in the good side by apologizing since I am worried something wrong happens. I also apologize alot if I do something wrong because once again I don't wanna lose her, her being my only closest friend who is a girl. But then I feel worried maybe apologizijg too much is annoying and it's just a never ending loop. I also usually take no time to reply to her which I heard isnt too good to do. But I am also quite worried since school starts soon for us and she also wanted to play games together but I am not really used to talking to girls since as said she is my only close friend who is a girl And I would be so much more of an introvert IRL or in a call. Since I don't wanna be too awkward. She is an introvert aswell but less than me. I just don't always know if she started hating me or not.. It's painful.

pvalh9,How do you stop hating on someone who has done you wrong?,"It has been more than 2 years since I have learned about the truth and I have been trying to forget about the wrongdoings of the person, however I still get reminded of it at times and I feel a lot hatred towards the person. I was deceived and taken advantage of for 6 years, I hate all the memories, moments, time and money I have invested on this person. The worst character I have ever came across and led me to trust issues and distancing from people. 

The person lacks in every way and is always envious and jealous of others success, wealth and appearance. Constantly boasting, gossiping, and spreading false rumours about people who are more superior, to feel better. Basically pure evil. I can’t comprehend how someone can plot such a despicable plan for years just to destroy another human being who has been genuine and sincere throughout. 

I was such a fool, blinded and forgiving over and over again. Please take my advice, do not take people lightly, always have your guard up and choose the people around you wisely.

pv9vem,Fear of regrets,"Currently I'm studying but I feel like when i finish university and going to work I'll have people constantly testing me or comparing with me, and I know no one will be there for me. I don't know what I'll be working on. If I regret my job? If I just end alone working and not knowing what I really want to do? I see many people working all day every day and I ask myself wether I'll be able to handle it. Uni is sometimes just hard. There's so much people better than me in many ways that i don't know if I will be able to get anything. I'm constantly thinking wether i'll have regrets in the future and I just can't continue like this. It's a so intrusive thought and maybe i'll change my career but maybe I regret that too... 

I'm starting to think friends are important for me, despite the fact that I don't think anyone is trustworthy. I just don't like it, to think that I'm depended on other people than myself but I can't avoid it and i hate it. They won't even care about me. During this pandemic I lost some contact that I had and it made uni a lot harder. It was just me alone against the courses and I felt hopeless all the time. I could study normally up to 1 and a half semesters but now i feel so much doubts and I don't know anyone to talk about it. My parents are just losers and I think I'll end like them and my few ""friends"" are just doing their thing.  Maybe I don't deserve anything for studying and I have to earn things but it's just I don't feel that I'm ready. I don't trust myself. I was constantly rejected in school and have so much fear. I don't even think i had a childhood. I just feel faint-hearted and that no one will trust me in the future and i can't engage to anything because of my doubts and I keep dissapointing people. I'll end just like my parents and time just keeps passing by. 

I just want to run away. I just want this pandemic to get over to continue studying by inertia of seeing people doing it in the library.",2021-09-25 21:43:51

At some point, I was talking to a shaman, yes a literal shaman, and I was describing my anxiety to him, and he asked a series of questions. 

Do you blame your eyes for the things they see?
Do you blame your ears for everything they hear?

No? Then why do you hold your mind to such high standards? We can't control all the thoughts we have, but we do have the ability to choose how to respond to them. 

There are a lot of pieces of advice that have helped me over the years, but this one was a special kind of breakthrough. You're thoughts are not always your own, but your reactions always are. 

We are powerless when it comes to controlling every thought that crosses our minds. Our power comes from choosing how to respond or not respond to these thoughts. Strive for improvement not perfection. One day at a time we march towards a better version of ourselves.",2021-09-25 21:33:27

pv987s,social butterfly to recluse,"my social anxiety is horrible. i can handle hanging out with one or two people but anymore makes me so anxious and i just want to leave so desperately. it’s like these alarms in my head start blaring because i know i’m going to have to endure conversation i’m not a part of nor do i know about, inside jokes/references i won’t get and will have to awkwardly listen, etc… now im a very good conversationalist and i am in no way bad at being in a group, but i just hate being there. 

i can pretend to enjoy myself and drink a beer or something and have forced small talk with people i don’t know, but god i would so much rather be at home stress free. every time i try to hang out with groups of people i just get over looked and ignored every time and after a while i guess i’ve just developed anxiety towards groups because i feel i will be left out. now don’t get me wrong, yes they were bad friends and most friend groups won’t ignore people they bring to hang out, but there my friend is where you are wrong. they’re all the same. 

i’ve tried and tried to make friends with my peers, younger, older, anyone. everyone just ignores me. i have no friends besides my coworkers. i tried to hang out with them before and they ignored me. i hate it so much, now anytime someone asks me to hang out i get excited and then have to awkwardly make an excuse once i find out all of this persons friends will be there. and i don’t regret it. because i know if i were to force myself to go, i would hate it and be left out trying to get drunk in a corner by myself. god sometimes even the thought of having to endure more social awkwardness makes me want to cry. it makes my soul cringe. 

and i’ve tried to be that guy who starts conversation when it gets awkward but it seems no one else wants to put in the effort to hold a goddamn conversation. it makes me so mad and sad. now because of my “friends” (who also talked a lot of shit on me during said hangouts), i have social anxiety. i try to be a virtuous and genuine person but it’s just a weak spot to be exploited to everyone else. i just get lied to and tested to my limit just because it’s “fun” for someone else to see me get emotional. i hate everyone. no wonder it’s hard to find good people in the world, they all just get taken advantage of until they realize being bad is the only way to have respect. fuck this society, i don’t want friends anymore because no one cares what i have to say so all i can do is scream into the void and listen to my own insanity.",2021-09-25 21:11:59

I'm really struggling with not having a safe space/safe person I can go talk to or a safe space to be in when I'm having a panic attack, sensory overload or am just not feeling 100%. By safe person I also mean teacher, because teachers can often be more supportive than the other kids. In terms of safe space, like a classroom or something else.

The teacher who used to provide me this support, and did since I was a freshman just left this week and it was extremely sudden. It's been so long with his support and it feels odd without it. His last day I quite literally got home and cried (a bit embarassing I know).

I used to seek out support in the student help center that was only open to people with disabilities (like learning disabilities, anxiety, depression, ADHD etc) but that has been opened to everyone this year and I constantly feel judged there. My anxiety and autism are very visible, if something is bugging me everyone is going to know.

Over quarantine I had a whole personality revamp and changed myself COMPLETELY because I wanted to be a better, pure person. I think I succeeded in that, because I got to college and was trying my absolute hardest for the first 3 weeks to be nice to all of the new people I was meeting. Everything was going well, I had even started talking to this guy I thought was cute and one of the things he said he liked about me was how caring and comforting I was to be around. This obviously made me happy because this was the goal of my whole personality change over quarantine. This guy is super nice, we weren’t in a committed relationship by any means, we were just talking. But, I fucked up last weekend. I got super drunk when I went out and ended up kissing his friend. Naturally this guy found out and I felt so extremely shitty about it the entire next day. It actually sparked a panic attack for me which made me go home because I couldn’t handle the guilt and anxiety. I ended up talking to the guy in person and we worked everything out- he claimed to not be mad and said he felt like he just wanted to be friends with me for a few days, so he was glad we were having this conversation. However, for the past week since the incident, there has been this god awful, lingering feeling of anxiety in my stomach over this entire situation. Am I a good person still?

I want to give up and literally die, I feel like the shittiest person ever and this feeling of anxiety that comes with is not helping my mental health at the moment.

pv8rqb,Help me help my brother.,"Hey, so I myself am suffering from anxiety since the time I can remember, but all I heard from my parents and family members was that I feared a lot (was a coward in other words). And I thought I was like that I didn't know that it was a suffering from GAD until recently when I just wanted to die. I searched for my symptoms online and found out I had GAD. Since then I have been doing a lot of research about it ...reading books, videos , etc. 

From this I realised that even my younger brother (21) was also going through Depression. All the symptoms indicate it and he always speaks of how death brings peace. We have lost 3 very close uncles and my grandmother in a span of 5 years. We both were very young to process those emotions and I feel that is what is causing him us these problems. I tried to reach out to him many times in the past and I am actively trying but he doesn't open up . 

I  told him what I was going through for that he was very supportive and insisted on me going to therapy and all. But when I even straight up told him that he too had Depression, he just ignores it and says that he doesn't. But I know for sure that he does because he keeps taking about death and he doesn't go out , doesn't have any friends and I have never seen him laugh. He is cranky a lot and keeps hitting walls and breaking stuff. 

I even told him to go to a therapist and sent him sources to cope up but he's not following those. It's like he doesn't want to be helped and just wants to die. 

After all this I don't know what to do now, my mother is very religious and believes this is all black magic and Satan's doing. 

Please help me help my brother. I love him a lot and I don't want to see him suffering like this.

It’s always been energetically draining for me to be around people and to be out in the world, even (sometimes especially) when I’m with people I like and doing a fun activity.

pv8muf,Panic attack in class,"Yesterday morning in class I said something and my teacher snapped at me out of nowhere. 

She had asked a question and I said that it was vague (because I always try to answer the questions and participate in class but it’s difficult to answer a question if I don’t know what she’s asking) and she snapped at me saying that I had been “coming for her all morning” and “muttering things under my breath” and that I’m done talking and I had no idea what she was talking about. I tried to say that it was just a vague question and I don’t know how to answer a vague question but she cut me off and said “no we’re done.” 

I tried to stop myself but I was only able to hold back a panic attack for like ten seconds. As soon as it started she told me that I should leave the classroom (and my friend asked a minute later if she could come out to check on me and she did). I ended up going to the LRC (the learning resource center) to calm down. (I had taken the SAT and ACT in there because I have extended time and frequent breaks and the person who proctored my tests said that I could come there if I was feeling overstimulated in school). 

Anyway I haven’t seen that teacher since yesterday morning when I had the panic attack and my friend told me that she’s going to talk to me next week. The only thing I can think of that could’ve set her off is that I said earlier (in a very polite way) that something she was doing may not have been the best thing (she was messing with my friend who also has anxiety about stuff that was important to her, the same friend who came out to check on me).

I don’t understand how either of these things could have caused this reaction and I’m a senior now but I’ve had a relatively good relationship with this teacher since tenth grade. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to handle the situation?

Everytime I quit xanax 2-3 days later I get this weird insomnia but it goes away in a few days nothing too serious. I read that xanax half life is pretty short and this is why the withdrawal effects are more severe. 

This time I am prescribed klonopin which has a 3x times longer half life. So does this mean that if I use this drug for a few weeks and then quit the withdrawal effects will be mild to zero since it's in my system for a longer time and it tapers itself more slowly?

I feel like I’m losing control and that the reality is slipping. 

Now, health anxiety and dissociation when combined are the worst. I go from thinking I’m going insane to thinking I’m going insane + probably because I have a tumor which I know I don’t because I had a normal brain MRI a year ago. Still, I’m eager to get another brain MRI just to be sure. 

Also, I’m always light-headed. My head feels empty and also heavy almost all the time. I feel like, I’m only half focused/aware. When I walk I feel like I walk weird and that everything is fuzzy. And when I read, I have to try harder for the sentences to register in my head. I mean I understand them but I forget them right away. It scares me so much that the panic/anxiety is almost constant.

pv75s0,Huge anxiety and stress at new work assignment. How to handle?,"Hi all, I work as an IT data specialist consultant at a consultancy firm in a western European country. Now currently I am one week into a new assignment where I'm seconded to a company and it is absolutely making me mentally stressed out (even now on the weekend constantly thinking about work, ruminating all the time, not being able to sleep, highly emotional) to the point that it is making me physically ill (headaches, waking up with a knot in my stomach, fatigued etcetera). It is my second assignment after having been seconded about 2 years to another company.

Now personally, I think there are a number of factors contributing to this.

- First one is probably the biggest and is within myself, in that I'm quite anxious by nature and new job situations are always tricky to me unless I know that the job at hand is one that I can handle 100% with my skills or I can at least get by with a bit of learning. This anxiety is something I'm planning on getting professional help with, but right now that anxiousness is all too prevalent and not helping.
- Second is that the (first) project I was put on at this new company requires knowledge of a tool unknown to me. I am the only specialist that is going to work on that part, so I don't really have someone to work with who can guide me. Also this project has a tight deadline that I doubt I can make under these circumstances. I think my seniority in this was overestimated, since it's a whole new game as oppossed to what I did before.
- Third is that even with this project going which is already probably hard to complete by the deadline, a flock of people is coming to me to ask me to help on their projects, which is also a lot to handle.

Now I'm feeling shit the whole time, even when I'm off of work. I told my manager at my consultancy firm the problems that I was encountering and also the stress and physical symptoms it is causing me to have. He was very understanding and trying to accomodate to make the new place work for me. He also said that they'd stand behind me and that if things didn't work out, they would search something else for me.

This made me feel a bit more relaxed for a while, but after that it has been non-stop worrying and feeling bad again for me. Now I'm quite worried that if I go on like this, it will have longer-lasting effects on my health.

As I see it now, it's just too much for me given my current mental state. Is it too much to ask from my employer to take me off the assignment and find a more fitting/easier one for me? Given that I've been a good, loyal and hard-working employee before. Never sick, making the clients happy. During this time of an easier assignment I want to go to a psychologist to handle the anxiety I have, to avoid these things in the future.

This has become a bit of a rant but I'm just kind of losing it here and am afraid of my mental state right now...",2021-09-25 19:22:21
pv73kh,Advice needed for partner's imagined medical anxiety. [Potential medical trigger],"I (M40) am married to an anxious person (F36). She is anxious because of an abusive childhood, and it manifests in a lot of different ways. She does a lot of catastrophizing and the worst is her imagined medical issues. She will stub her toe and think it will result in her having to have her leg amputated which will result in me leaving her which will result in her death, etc. Her main trigger is imagined cancer. 

If her shoulder hurts, if her side hurts, if her chest hurts, if she has period cramps, if she has a headache, etc. anything will make her think it's secretly cancer and she is 100% going to die. We know that she behaves this way as a way to protect herself, to keep her ""alert"" of a threat. We also know some of the anxiety might be alleviated by regular physical check ups, but of course we're American and thus don't have health care. (She also has some issues with medical situations/doctors that also causes anxiety.)  We are working on the doctor situation, but I know that won't solve everything since we can't just go to a doctor for every bruise and stomachache.

She loses a lot of sleep every night fantasizing about how she's dying, how this is the last four hours of her life, how I'll react when I wake up to her dead, or how I'll react if she has to go through cancer treatments, etc., etc., etc. She knows she shouldn't think about stuff, but she is incapable of turning off her brain. She will obsess about things for days, and then the cat will playfully bite her and she'll obsess about dying from a cat bite for the next few days until the next thing captures her imagination.

She is already in therapy, and she has specifically talked to this therapist (and other, past therapists) about this issue. So far, none of them have given her any useful ways to deal with these intrusive thoughts. She is also incapable of googling how to fix stuff like this because just googling stuff will implant a new fear into her head. (I'm sure some of you know how it is.)

What can I do to help? What can she do to help? There are nights she gets very little sleep because she's up all night thinking she's having a heart attack or whatever, which only makes her anxiety worse when she has to get up early for work, etc.  It is really stressful for me, too, both because I can't help, and because I feel like my partner isn't present because she's obsessing over imagined illnesses.

Any help is appreciated, thanks.

pv72nf,Not so fun story,"I been having anxiety and depression problems since my early teens (28 now) and for the past few months felt better than ever with no meds or anything until I injured my eardrum few weeks ago...
I can handle pain quite well that was not a problem, not fun either but manageable. The real horror started with vertigo (got an inner ear inflammation because of the eardrum problem that gave me constant dizziness, lightheadedness and nausea) and of course my old friend anxiety kicked in and been having constant anxiety and panic attacks since then.
After the ear cleared out i had chest tightness and tingling in left arm, so I freaked out even more and went to A&E, and after blood samples, x rays of heart and lungs everything was in perfect condition so the doctor told me it's my anxiety.
I felt better the same day, but then in next few days i started filing tingling in my left cheek, and last night tingling in arm and face got worse, started getting worried and panic attack kicks in wit a headache and shortness of breath and trouble concentrating on whatever people are telling me in that moment so I  make another trip to the A&E with the same result (but without x-ray or mri because doctor was so confident it's just stress and anxiety, as he explaind me if it was something more serious, i would loose muscle feeling so my face would droop, and I wouldn't be able to move my hand).
 I had million panic attacks and anxiety issues over the years but they've never gave me such physical symptoms that lasted for days and weeks, so whoever is reading this, go and check yourself out definitely - but don't panic, because if you think it's your head it probably is.",2021-09-25 19:17:01
pv71st,Really struggling with anxiety right now after a night of drinking.,"Hi all. I don’t normally drink a ton. And tonight I may have had 4 drinks the whole night. That said even then my sleep isn’t that interrupted by it and Id generally go home and pass out and wake up the next day. 

Right now is very different. And I’m scared. 
I can’t sleep for more than like 15 minutes at a time. My thoughts are racing so fast they don’t even feel like mine. When I was dreaming my thoughts were also racing so fast it felt like the characters within my dreams were all malfunctioning. Without the auditory hallucination piece it literally feels like I have multiple voices in my head all trying to follow their own train of thought. And I’m ping ponging too and from every thought that comes up. Like I have no control of my thoughts. 

Is this typical for anxiety? What is this? It feels like I’ve lost some major sense of control, or like I just snapped. Like I’m about to being taken over by other personalities or something. It took some effort even writing this and staying focused.",2021-09-25 19:15:32

pv6upa,How do I handle the anxiety when posting on social media?,"Every time I posted on social media I feel like I’m being judged by other users. I mean I *crave* to see people’s reactions yet at the same time I’m also so nervous that I cannot stop checking my phone. And every time people are liking my posts- I feel so excited yet at the same time anxious that I cannot stop checking my phone (or even thinking about it). I’m prone to think something may be wrong with my posts if someone’s seen my posts yet they are not liking them.

Is there something wrong with the way I see social media? How do I stop feeling this way- how can I be more confident in expressing myself- even online? And by social media I’m referring to something like Instagram- I have no idea why I don’t feel nervous at all when posting on Reddit- probably because nobody here knows me?

pv6rhw,I'm worried I'll never overcome agoraphobia. Feeling down & looking for advice/support.,"So I bought a book the other day that use low-intensity CBT techniques to treat agoraphobia. I've been slowly working through it and I'm feeling positive but it's only been a week & things take time.

Today I was supposed to attend a family gathering but even with taking my anxiety meds (which usually help), I still couldn't leave my house.

I just don't know how I’m going to move on from this current state of anxiousness. I used to be a relatively social person who’d study, go to work, see my friends regularly, travel by myself & take random trips to places.

Three years later (i.e. Now) I’m a shell of myself, I have no friends, I can’t work due to anxiety & other MH conditions & my future doesn’t look bright if this continues.

If anyone’s reading this who’s overcome agoraphobia, how did you do it? Do you have any advice?

pv6jen,Tinnitus and Anxiety Flare Up,"24m. Have had GAD and T as long as I can remember. T was generally mild and never paid attention to it. GAD could occasionally get bad and cause symptoms. But never worsened T. 

A week ago, I noticed a slightly new T sound. No idea what causes it. Sent me into a full panic questioning everything I did leading up to it, trying to figure out what caused it since I don’t listen to loud music, work in loud areas, or game on loud volume. Recounting every single noise I heard leading up to the morning I first noticed the new flutter pitch. Needless to say, I became hyperparanoid about EVERY sound I heard at home in ways I never have. I hear annoying high pitches from fridge and Xbox fan I didn’t used to hear, but idk if it’s because I’m listening too much now or what. I also think I’m interpreting random tv sounds on broadcast as having an annoying loud high pitched ring. 

I’m scared to do anything. Unfortunately have to wait 12 more days to see audiologist. In the meantime, I’m afraid it’s only downhill from here. I’m scared to use an electric toothbrush (not sonic), electric razor, drive, do laundry, get a haircut, etc. the hundreds and hundreds of google searches and Reddit searches have only made my feelings worse. Wear ear plugs when driving. Oh wait, another post says not to! (I drive a 2000 sedan. Not the quietest thing in the world but I’m sure it’s better than some louder trucks or utility vans). Am I over sensitive? Is it the anxiety? Will I decline to the point I can’t watch tv or cut my hair? It’s so much to think about!

pv6ctf,Visual disturbances with anxiety?,"Hi!

I’ve been having floaters, flashes, and then my peripheral vision is like static/ fuzzy and shaky sometimes? I’m just curious if anyone else deals with  visual disturbances or not. I’ve had myself convinced I have a brain tumor or something due to these symptoms.

I don’t really have any other symptoms along with the visual stuff besides dizziness, which I’ve been dealing with for a few years now, so nothing new there. I have no idea why the first thought when i’ve been having these symptoms is something in my brain but the anxiety i’ve been feeling is insane. I’ve wanted to go to the ER a few times, but with covid I’m nervous to do so, and i’m just nervous in general to find out anything potentially bad. I just try to reassure myself it’s my anxiety but then my mind starts wondering what if it’s not your anxiety, it’s a crazy cycle.

puou46,I've had enough,"I'm done with it all. For two and a half years I've been stuck in an anxiety loop that I can't break. It's a health anxiety and if someone told me I didn't have this condition with 100% certainty, I would be so happy and it would stop. The problem is, there's no way to test for it and give a yes or no diagnosis. I've been tested for it and told that I likely don't have it, but I still experience the symptoms out of nowhere and the only people that I know have these symptoms are the people that have this illness.

It's epilepsy, and it scares the shit out of me. I had two seizure incidents as a child. I have tried so hard to trust the doctors and the experienced medical professionals that have dealt with me but I still get symptoms. I think that it's going to happen at any second, so I get scared no matter where I am or what I'm doing. I can DO things, but I do them because it's a necessity and have to rush home. If I try to enjoy things like walks, films, music, video games, there is this constant slow burning anxiety underneath that is telling me that ""it"" could happen at any moment. If I get the symptom, that's it, my day is done and I'm on my bed all day waiting for it to happen.

I've gone through four different SSRI's, anti anxiety medication, therapy, exposure therapy, a healthier lifestyle, I stopped drinking two years ago, I have zero caffeine. But still, it persists all day everyday. I cannot give anything any attention, I have this loop in my head ALL day EVERYDAY, 365 days a year. I've also tried just ""letting it work itself out"". Nope, does nothing. I was told to be kind to myself and if I needed to spend days or weeks doing nothing then to do it. I did it, it didn't help.

I haven't been able to work for four months, because my anxiety has now manifested in to completely physical symptoms. I've been able to rationalise my thoughts, but the anxiety still wrecks havoc on my body. I don't get palpitations, racing heart, fast/slow breathing. No, I get the stupidest symptoms ever. I become instantly fatigued, like I've been hit by a truck of exhaustion, my eyes are visibly heavy, I go pale, I look physically sick and my legs go like jelly, like I'm narcoleptic.

I've now recently purchased a blood pressure machine, an oxygen meter, a blood sugar reader. Because I'm trying to diagnose myself with something, because there's something happening with me physically and I'm convinced of it. There is no joy in my day, the person I was a few years ago has gone and been replaced by someone I do not know. I'm scared of everything, I'm a idiot and all I want to be is a functioning person who contributes to society.

I've resigned myself to the fact that my life is going to be like this until I die. Because no matter how hard I work, no matter how much I put it, it doesn't make a difference. It doesn't make the tiniest dent in how I feel.

The doctors are out of ideas other than depression and anxiety. I'm out of ideas and I'm becoming numb, you could tell me I'd die tomorrow and I'd feel that it was deserved because all I'm doing is wasting people's time and energy.

I did some research and read an article on having a healthy gut. Something about mind gut connection. Anyways I started drinking probiotics. It took about 2 weeks before I saw some improvements and now the bloating is lessened. I don't know if its placebo but my mom noticed it as well. That my tummy isnt as big as before. There is still some bloating but not as bad as before. I also watch how much food I eat. More veggies too. 

Then I also started using this app. Helps with meditation. My bpm is usually high. Too much thinking, stress etc. 

Im on my 6th day today using this meditation app and my bpm is on the 60 to 70 resting. This was hard for me to achieve before. And also it helps with sleep. Even without meds my bpm is at 68 to 75. Small steps i keep on telling myself.

I have just turned 21 (M). I study at University and I'd say I have a good amount of decent friends. I'm nice guy but I have always struggled with all sorts of relationships. I struggle with anxiety though, and where I am right now,  we are in lockdown for our sixth week. I have been overthinking everything, in particular my social life, dating life, whether I will end up alone and whether I am wasting my youth. It's gotten pretty bad, and I just can't relax. I don't know whether this worrying is useful or not, aka whether this is a genuine worry.  Its keeping me tense, anxious, and unable to relax. 

I'm thinking of making a doctors appointment and trying medication (I've tried therapy before). I am seeing a psychotherapist currently, but we haven't really discussed this, should I discuss this more with her? What should I do? Am I in the right subreddit? My biggest worry is that I am wasting my youth - I feel I don't have enough friends, that I'm not attractive and that I don't go out enough.

pv433r,Xanax. Anxiety is ruining my life.,"I’ve posted here like 10 times. Thank you to all who have taken the time out of their lives to respond.  No, I haven’t taken the medication yet. I wish I Did. Just don’t have the courage. 

Okay I’m gonna make this as short as I can. I used to take Xanax(as prescribed) but it’s been a couple years and I’ve been living in an anxiety induced hell for 2 years. I legitimately don’t even know what normal feels like anymore. All I know is what I feel now isn’t. I’m a stranger in my own body and head. I have all the physical and mental symptoms of anxiety you can imagine. I kept thinking “I woke up like this one day maybe I’ll wake up normal”. But I didn’t. I’ve always had your more normal anxiety. But this, this is some next level shit I can’t escape and haven’t for 2 years. I’m not even able to be a father to my nearly 2 year old. I don’t leave my house and when I do it’s a mental battle and I feel like the world is caving in.  

Long story short I said, my bad. I got put on Xanax again to get me out of this rut. Once I’m able to function I’m getting on something more long term. I’ve let this eat me alive. I can’t escape this hole alone. What can I expect when taking the Xanax? I really don’t want to freak the fuck out and have worse anxiety. I’m trapped in this cycle because my anxiety is so bad I’ve convinced myself that medicine will make it worse so I don’t take it and just suffer.  But what can I expect while taking it? Initial onset? I hate any type of “high” and i especially don’t want to be “high” and anxious. I basically just want to know if this will give me relief without freaking out.

HELP ME PLZ,"(24,F) I moved the country from US to UK a year ago, August 2020, to be with my husband and haven’t been able to start work yet or drive, so I have time to sit at home and be worried about everything and moving countries is a big change. 

I don’t know if I’ve begun to develop ANXIETY but a month ago I started worrying about lumps in my neck and my appt to get the covid vaccine (put it off twice) 

A few days later, my lower right back started aching really deep while sitting in a car(dont remember feeling anxious at the time), got meds for UTI that took the back pain away on day 5 but came back on day 7 my last day of my meds but even worse pain came back extending to the top of my buttcheek(worse when sitting down) & I started googling and it mentioned cancer & I started freaking out and I think that made the pain worse for weeks and started having more symptoms after googling things (night sweats). Went to the doctor and they did blood tests(normal) checked my back & neck, couldn’t see anything, and put me on the long waiting list for general physician.

Since then, I’ve been having cold night sweats that wake me up every night at 3am(some nights worse than others) and feel wide awake but no reason to be sweating, lower back pain(turned into a burning aching feeling), and recently been having random hip aches, stomach rumbling. 

But my whole life I’ve been a deep sleeper and slept the WHOLE night. I haven’t slept the whole night for the past month due to back pain & soaking my pajamas in the night and realllly miss sleeping the whole night. 

Just got my FIRST VACCINE yesterday and didn’t look at the side affects (bc I knew I would get them if I looked) and haven’t felt anything) besides the continuous back pain which now radiates up my mid back and night sweats. I’m really hoping the night sweats and back pain go away now that my fear of the vaccine is over. Anyone else think this could be anxiety? 

Really don’t want to get on anxiety pills but waking up from night sweats/back pain for a month straight worries me. I’m not having nightmares(that I know of) but can you have night sweats from purely being stressed out this long?

How could your back start aching really bad while sitting down in a car? Torn muscle? Really don’t want to start a job feeling like this!",2021-09-25 14:05:22
pv2pux,Heart rate is lowering,"I have an Apple Watch and it’s been giving me more and more Low Heart Rate notifications in the past month. I’m not athletic at all.

They started to increase these last days and my heart went as low as 40bpm during sleep. Which is a record breaker for me. It used to stay between 45-50

As of writing this it’s registering 59bpm

Should I worry? I’m extremely afraid that I’m gonna have a cardiac arrest during my sleep.
I also started taking zoloft (25mg for now) 4 days ago but idk if it’s affecting it or not.

Anybody had similar experiences? Any suggestions?",2021-09-25 13:57:16
pv25w4,I’m so anxious rn,I cheated on an exam today. It was 25 questions and I answered it in 10 minutes. Im scared the computer will detect that I cheated and I’ll get caught. My friend helped me and maybe the computer caught that she was going through her answers at the same time. I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it. I’m in college and they take this stuff seriously. I’m so scared I’ll be dropped from this semester. I’ve seen a therapist who suspects I have GAD. It’s been hours and there’s been a pit in my stomach. I can’t stop shaking and crying while I think about it. I know I get anxious over a lot but it’s never been like this. I wanna rip my brain out of my head. I’m so scared right now. What if I ruin my life and my friends?? What will my family think? How can I even calm myself down. I don’t think I can sleep.

pv1uxo,Thanatophobia,"Trigger warning.. death.. 

I know I titled this thanatophobia. But I don’t think I have the phobia. It’s just something that scares me. Just like every other person. 

But I just need to vent a little..
I am absolutely terrified of dying. Not the act of dying. But just of being dead. Once you die you’re just nothing, for the rest of eternity, it’s just blackness. And that part there just absolutely terrifies me. I don’t ever want to die. 

Yeah, I know, you won’t even know you’re dead. But the fact is, I won’t be living this life anymore. I won’t ever live another life again. I won’t be enjoying hanging out with family, or my pets anymore. Or enjoying the sunset. Or the new cool games/movies they’ve got coming out every year. 

I will sit up crying for an hour because I can’t stop myself from thinking of this stuff. 

Thankfully this fear doesn’t stop me from living my life, but it does absolutely scare me and raises my anxiety through the roof when I actually let myself sit and think about it. I’ve even had panic attacks because of it.

pv1h21,What are you stories and symptoms?,"Hi everyone. I’m a 27F who’s had a terrible time since April of this year and I feel defeated. I need guidance. I need true reassurance because I can’t believe all my symptoms are anxiety related.
In April of this year I had a minor surgery to drain a cyst - totally unrelated (or maybe not?) during recovery I started to feel my first symptoms: tingling legs with restless legs. I’d never felt this in my life so I went to the ER, thought my antibiotics weren’t sitting well with me. I had my heart checked and blood word - was told it’s anxiety. 
About a week later I was grocery shopping, felt a sharp pain in my left arm that travelled to my chest and it was painful to breathe. I drove home in a panic, had my first ever panic attack once I got inside. Everything was numb and tingling, my face, body, my hands were curled up, my lips curled up, I couldn’t breathe, we didn’t know what was happening so my boyfriend rushed me back to the ER. Checked my heart again and was told it was a panic attack. A week after that my chest had a constant burning pain for a couple days, went back to ER and was told my chest wall was inflamed - prescribed naproxen for 10 days. The tingling in body continued on and off during this time and after. I felt better in the sun in the summer. Beach days were my favourite, I felt happy and my symptoms subsided. Symptoms would come and go throughout summer though. I started getting really cold - freezing. Doctor requested blood work. Everything was normal but my B12 level on a scale of 138-620 pmol/L was 192pmol/L and iron on a scale of 5-250 was at 30. I had been googling my symptoms during this entire time, scared to death I have MS. 
Palpitations, leg twitching, heaviness in legs and pins and needles in feet when driving. Last week I had an appointment with my GP for a full neurological exam. I passed everything. My doctor said because I had an MRI in February of this year and it came back clear (along with me passing the neurological exam) MS was highly unlikely. I brought up my B12 and Iron levels being low and my lifelong stomach issues maybe not absorbing these vitamins being the cause of my neurological symptoms and my doctor told me not to worry about those because they’re still within range. She then told me it’s anxiety and she’d like to put me on medication and therapy. I feel defeated because I don’t know how anxiety can cause these symptoms. I was diagnosed with situational anxiety as a teenager but that was just heart palpitations and nausea - nothing like this. It’s like my mind won’t accept anxiety for an answer and I’m almost praying it’s the low vitamin levels and nothing more serious. I feel helpless, I want to feel normal again, not worry about my future and present symptoms. Has anyone else had a similar situation or even a similar B12 situation? Anything helps.

pv15rd,Please can someone help with my feelings of guilt?,"So I have OCD that is linked to feeling guilty if, for example, I had a compliment from someone about something, I’d have to think to myself ‘well others have whatever they complimented too and a lot have it a lot better/nicer than me’. I also feel guilty as I have some good friends, travelled, although I have had my fair share of negative things to balance it out, eg: a rocky family life and don’t have much money so currently still live in my family home in my late 20s, which has resulted in a lot of difficult times over the years, have some health problems and never experienced romantic love despite being in an almost 3-year relationship. Ive also experienced difficulties including bullying amongst other various things. 

I just can’t shake this guilty feeling which might have stemmed from having a brother who has never worked and my parents giving him stuff and letting him get away with all sorts as ‘he’s missed out’. As a result, I’ve put up with a lot of bad treatment over the years. 

However, I overall enjoy where I live, I have a job in the sector I want to work however I’m just currently in an admin role and not making much money. (I have to justify having this by repeating to myself that it’s ‘just admin’ and ‘not that well paid’). Basically, just that others have a lot more than me. I also feel a bit anxious as I have ended up in a sector which I wanted to work in, which again isn’t a big deal as obviously I’ve made decisions and choices to work in this sector based on what I chose to do at university etc., and this is the same for anyone with a goal of being a vet, doctor etc. 

I just want someone to tell me I’m being ridiculous, I don’t have that much and shouldn’t feel guilty? I’d really appreciate the advice, thank you.",2021-09-25 11:52:18
pv0vra,"i moved into my uni dorms and i’ve never experienced this much anxiety before, what do i do","hi, i’ve had some panic attacks before due to some old bad memories but besides that i’ve never rly had other problems.

now that i’ve moved into college i’m suddenly filled with dread and now i’m thinking anxiety is just overtaking me. every second of the day i’m thinking about how i have to go out and be social, how the communal bathrooms are so uncomfortable, even trivial things like exhibiting bodily functions scare me. i’m also thinking about changing majors and like idk it scares me bc my future is just not certain anymore and that’s so so scary

i start class monday but every time i think about how i have to walk over, my stomach turns and i lie in bed in pain thinking im absolutely pathetic for having a weak body :// i fight to get up and i end up feeling fine after walking for a bit, but that initial moment is scary because i feel like i’m going to puke in public

it’s been a week and i still cannot get adjusted… i think i’ve also been down with stomach flu or something so I threw up the first few days and I’m continuing to feel queasy. 

it also doesn’t help that i’m not very social but everyone around me is just so energetic and i feel my energy just getting sapped. i’m so done and college hasn’t even started wtf

sorry this is all over the place idk what to do. is there anything i can do to just. calm myself down or something. i’ve been feeling suffocated and i couldn’t breathe well a bit ago and i feel so pathetic but i have to get over this ://",2021-09-25 11:30:37

Ever since my first one I can recall from November of last year, they seem to be getting more frequent and inhibiting over time, and it’s been frustrating trying to pinpoint a possible cognitive/psychological association behind them.

Earlier, I almost crashed when my heart rate spiked while driving, and I felt like I was beginning to lose my perception of reality–like I was watching myself die and accepting of the outcome.

puzinf,Afraid to be home alone? Tips appreciated!,"Hi all! Me (19F) and my boyfriend (21M) moved in together at new apartment about 2 months ago, and we left my bike sitting on our second story balcony, we figured there was no way that anyone would be able to get it down from there. Well, a couple weeks ago we had a friend over and we were talking pretty loud, and the walls are pretty thin in our complex and my boyfriend suddenly stops and said “did you guys hear that”? We all kind of thought nothing of it because as I said the walls are thin and it honestly wasn’t really anything too out of the ordinary, so we didn’t really bother checking. A couple hours later we walked our friend down to her car and there was a ladder on the side near our balcony which we thought was crazy because we had been talking about that, and we look up and the bike was gone. Ever since I’ve been afraid to be home alone (especially at night) even though I logically know they won’t come back or break in but my anxiety is getting the worst of me. At first it wasn’t too bad because my boyfriend and I worked basically the same schedule, but I since quit that job and am now home a little more often, usually without him and he works closing shifts. Some days are better than others but I’m really starting to get sick of the fear because it’s almost unbearable and quite frankly just annoying.

It’s to the point where I have to lay down in a fetal position and just wait it out and I have an extremely high pain tolerance. 

In July I was put on anxiety and depression medication because my doctor thought it was just from anxiety. (Only mild depression). But, it didn’t stop.

puykfk,"20M, seeking advice","Hey y’all,
   First time poster in this subreddit, long time lurker. I’m writing this because I’m seeking advice and/or suggestions on what I can do to turn myself around.
   My initial thoughts of how my dark thoughts and outlook on life started is when my parents got divorced around the time I was 7. Leading up to around my HS graduation and even sometimes now, my parents would leave me in the middle of their situations and use me as leverage in court hearings. My parents have been very heavy drinkers ever since I can remember and one scarring even that I remember from my parents is when my father threatened suicide by cop while I was in the house during one of his heavy drinking phases. Till this day both of my parents drink heavily and I feel little to no remorse for them anymore as I tell them that their bodies will no longer keep up with the abuse. 
   My HS school years were not horrible as I had a girlfriend from grades 10-12, all star athlete, worked a part time job, and graduated top 10% of my class. There are several things through HS that I regret and wish I could turn around: 1) Get my License(still don’t have like a dumbass) 2) getting a girlfriend. My girlfriend and I had several breakups, countless arguments, and continued the relationship for way longer than we should have. We broke up on bad terms and it is something I regret to this day, but more emotions would spark if I apologized rather than leaving it be and letting her live her life. The breakup occurred around the middle of my senior year and shortly after was my first experiences with marijuana. 
Following my breakup, I took a look at myself in the mirror and hated what I saw. I am 6’3 and at the time of the breakup I weighed 270 pounds. Currently, I am 185 pounds and have maintained this weight for several years now. I thought by losing the weight I would gain confidence and energy, but this hasn’t been the case. This led to my marijuana abuse in my freshman year of college. I made friends, memories and quite a bit of money through weed in my freshman year but it drained me even more than the weight loss. Leading into my 2nd year of college, I quit using marijuana for about 6 months and as a result I lost all of my friends. Through this period, I had a lot of trouble maintaining my anxiety(something I should see a therapist about) and just finding things to do or enjoy. 
   I would consider two people my friends and they aren’t even people I can talk to about anything an can rely on for advice. I have trouble relaying my thoughts to them in fear of them not understanding my circumstances or just simply not caring. I find it hard to find people with similar interests as me in my area. All of my HS peers seem to either be engaged/pregnant, brainwashed by Leftist-College propaganda, or trying to become the next big social media influencer. I become very lonely when I can’t share my interest in a certain subject, talk about commonalities, or drive around and go do something. 
   Currently, I have just started my junior year in college and am quitting marijuana again, but not because of abuse of it, I just feel the need to quit uplift my mood. I know I should probably seek a psychiatrist to pinpoint my anxiety and NEED to get my license as it makes me feel like a complete failure that I don’t have it at 20 years old. I feel like a idiot for even writing this, but I have no one to talk to in regards of advice and wanted to get all of this off of my chest. 
   I just feel like I have wasted the past 6 years of my life and will end up like my parents. I would like to enjoy the feeling of not being an outcast or loser in my mind again. I have never seen suicide as a solution to any problem and I would hate to see myself become addicted and brain dead through antidepressants, but I feel like the things I enjoyed in the past to reduce stress just make me more frustrated and annoyed with life. 

(If you have any other questions feel free to ask because I know this isn’t the best format or use of punctuality/grammar. It’s just hard to express my feelings into words)",2021-09-25 08:47:30
puyfar,[19F] with separation and relationship anxiety. Could use some advice :),"I have the most amazing and incredible boyfriend [18M] in the entire world. We have been together for 15 months now and I love him with everything inside me. I have never felt this much love for someone in my life. The longer that we have been together, the more I’ve realized how much I want to spend time with him. If we could hang out every day, I would honestly be the happiest person. 

When we aren’t together, I have this crippling separation anxiety. I’m okay for about 24 hours without seeing him  before I develop the physical symptoms of anxiety, resulting in nightly crying sessions and a stomach that’s tied up in knots. 

I didn’t realize how insecure of a person I am until i realized how head over heels I love I am. He said no to hanging out today so he could have a family night and I immediately started blaming myself thinking that maybe something I said earlier has made him not want to see me. I’m so afraid that if I’m overly affectionate or overly romantic that he’s going to stiff arm me (even though that’s something he’s never done before). So I’ve caught myself pulling away from him and that is the last thing I want to do. 

Does anyone have any advice for me? How can I cope with this anxiety?",2021-09-25 08:38:19
puye6i,Strange jolt/zap feeling when falling asleep,"Hi everyone, 

I’ll start off by saying that my sleep schedule is absolute shit at the moment. I feel like I use my phone in bed so much because I feel like I’ll starve off the anxiety so I’m sleeping around 3am and these incidents make it so hard to stay asleep. 

What I’m experiencing is weird , you know that gorgeous feeling just as you’re falling asleep, I’ve been feeling like zapped out of it. Sometimes I feel like I can’t breathe and my heart starts pounding, other times it feels like a switch in my brain saying “nope wake up”. It’s hard to explain. 

It’s incredibly annoying and strange - the most bizarre thing was yesterday, it literally felt like someone hit me in the head. I always worry that this means I won’t be able to sleep again but I always fall asleep in the end. 

Is anyone familiar with this? Maybe it’s the mixture of anxiety and sleep deprivation?",2021-09-25 08:36:12
puydtn,I went to therapy for the first time yesterday. i did not like it at all.,"It was GROUP therapy. there were other people.

 here's how it went.

 People were going around saying introductions. When it came my turn, everyone looked at me. i HATE it when people look at me. it's the worst.

 I Tried to say my intro but it was so hard. I didn't even have to say that much stuff. Just like 3 very simple things about myself. But I still couldn't get the words to come out. like. it felt like my body just wasn't letting me. i just said ""i.. uh... um.."" and i felt the tears coming to my eyes. so I just cried in front of like 15 ppl and just got myself to say this,""i cant talk"". 

I had a panic attack too.

I feel so stupid bc of this. Everyone else there was so friendly and they seemed so.. extroverted. they talked a lot... And i'm the fucking loser over here that's so anxious where I can't fucking say what my name is! I couldn't say anything at all ! I dreaded the whole time. I hate this.

 they had to put me on meds bc of how high my anxiety was. started the meds today and they're extremely effective and are said to do something in a couple of days 

&#x200B;

I want to leave  that therapy group forever. I don't wanna ever come back.",2021-09-25 08:35:35
puyd1u,I CAN NOT TAKE THIS ANYMORE..IM TIRED OF FEELING LIKE THIS AND I HAVE NO SUPPORT !!,I am struggling with severe anxiety and panic attacks. I feel like my family doesn’t support me at all. I always get the “just calm down” responses from them. These are my in laws considering that my actual blood family (my mom; my dad passed away) responds the same way as well. I am having a hard time with day to day things… even going to work. I do my best to hide it but today I really broke down. And the responses that I am getting are hurting me even more. “Oh my god…why are you crying now?” “What’s wrong now?” “I don’t know what to say anymore” These are the people I look towards for support because they are the only people I have. I don’t have any friends which is sad at my age (31). Sometimes I just don’t have anyone to talk to..or be a friend….I feel like I am on my last straw here with my panic attacks and anxiety…..I feel like I am crying out for help with no support besides myself…..I can’t do this anymore…..,2021-09-25 08:34:11
puy7s3,Everything is getting to be too much..,"I’m not too sure anyone will see this, even if no one does, I just need to get this out of my brain. 

My family has known for about a year my mom has stage 4 colon cancer. 2 days ago she took a big step by having a surgery to have the tumor removed. But they also noticed it’s spread more into her liver than before. And a week prior they had found nodules on her lungs as well. The doctors are trying to decide on if they should put her back on chemo (one of her doctors thinks they should and the other disagrees saying it would be too much for her body to handle). Or just let it ride it’s course and give her the best life we can with whatever time she has left. 

My sister has been a huge help in taking care of my mom and being at the doctors with her because I work 2 jobs and she lives at the house with them. I’ve called out of work before so I can be there, but then work gets upset if I’m gone too much. And then I feel guilty for my sister having to do so much and I feel like I know nothing on the situation because I don’t have the chance to be there. But then I feel bad not being at work or work gets upset I’m not there. Trying to be with my family, work 2 jobs, and try and just maintain some sense of balance is getting to be so hard. I have no motivation for anything left in me. I want to be helpful to everyone, but I also just want to be alone so badly. 

I’m not sure what the point of this was. I just know I needed to get these words out, but I have no close friends to talk to. So I’m sorry to anyone who had to read this. But if you did read it, I truly thank you and I hope you had a good day today.",2021-09-25 08:24:54

puxxqi,"Really bad Hypochondria, have tried absolutely everything. What more can I try?","I \*only\* get healthy anxiety as a result of physical pain. I recently had a 24 Hour holter monitor done, a bilaterval leg scan thingy, a chest CT, to check for a pulmonary emoblism or DVT because I had a slightly elevated (95) d-dimer level and they all came back clear. I had my heart checked out 5 years ago and there was some benign anomaly or some sort. I've had other sorts of tests before too, a breast ultrasound even though im 23, and i think the thing i think is chest pain is fibryocystic breast stuff.

I don't have the kind where you think  you have some type of rare disease when you stub your toe. I think I have a heart attack constnatly, because I get jaw and left arm pain a lot and breast/chest pain on rare occassions. Now that I've gotten that d-dimer level back, which was just because of a routine check-up screening, I've been just a wreck.

I was voluntarily hospitalized and stayed there for 2 months at one of the best facilities there is. I appeared to get better, but they did nothing to help my anxiety, I begged them for help and no one did anything, I'm not even exagerrating. it was all focused on depression and suicidality (which I don't have, i do have depression but not the other one). I got better because I was checked on every 15 minutes. then i left and slowly got worse and worse. It helped my depression because I was in a community for once, but as soon as I left none of them wanted to be friends depsite sharing like deep af shit. I can barely afford another hospital and anywher eI go will take my phone and I need to be able to talk to my girlfriend.

I've 20 therapists, most of them drop me and it's devastating, or are just so terrible I can't see them anymore. And all everyone fucking does it just try to do breathing exercises or tell you to accept it. I haven't heard a new piece of advice in a year. I've had like 7 psychiatrists and can't find one that has time for me or takes my insurance. And been on like 15 different meds at least. And I can't stick to taking meds because I have crazy side effects that make my hyponchodria worse. But I was on like 6 different meds at once at the hospital and those didn't even work for the anxiety. I tried a 10 course ketamine treatment that didn't do anything. I'm way too fucking scared of ECT and TMS and those are for depression anyway not anxiety.

I do NOT know what else to try. Mushrooms are legal in a place near me, so I am going to try to find someplace that sells me because I think the only thing that might help is some sort of spiritual enlightenment and acceptance of death. I can only be lucky I guess that I've only been like this for 2 years. I had some abusive relationships that I think made this kind of thing start. I wasn't like this before, I didn't even have anxiety. it's so fucking unfair. 

My left leg really fucking hurt yesterday and I'm afraid of a blood clot. It's better today so it doesn't make sense that it would be a clot? But I don't have any idea why it would have hurt like that and for so long, if it was DOMS it would have been the other leg.

Please help me. What else can I try?",2021-09-25 08:06:16

puxsf7,I hate my anxiety so much,"Urgh this is just to vent and get reassurance, I guess. So the other day I accidentally spilled water on my MacBook. Took it to the apple store and they said they could repair it and it was no problem and asked if I had a backup. I had just backed it up to an external hard drive a couple weeks ago (my iCloud is full) and hadn’t really done much in the meantime so I said it was fine if it got wiped during repairs. 

Of course, since then I’ve been panicking that I maybe didn’t back it up properly or something went wrong with the drive or my data will be corrupted or something. I’m beating myself up for not having them check before sending the laptop off for repairs. 

So now it’s 3:30 in the morning and I’m absolutely panicked that I’ve made a mistake that will lose all my schoolwork and pictures and everything. And I’m so angry at myself for not putting things onto OneDrive as well as the hard drive. Planning on going to the apple store first thing in the morning to have them check that I backed things up properly in case I can stop the repair before things are wiped if I messed up the back up. 
I don’t even know if they’ll be able to help me or if I’ll just make a fool of myself but I’m so so so panicked and I hate my brain for this (and for not backing things up better).

Tonight has been the worst so far, the combo of waking up wheezing, dizzy, with a temp sent me into an anxiety attack, even harder to regulate my breathing. Ive finally started to calm down, my blue inhaler has helped my asthma and I have music on.

I’m not necessarily looking for solutions, maybe just a place for folk to share or vent. I must say I’m quite scared. I’m having flashbacks to the worst things I saw on tv earlier in the pandemic. I don’t want to end up in hospital. I finally stopped crying 15 minutes ago and I’ve barely cried at all since being on sertraline.

puwm6p,Discovered my dad is the root of my anxiety - cutting him out of my life - need advice or hear from someone who has gone through a similar situation,"I have struggled with panic anxiety disorder and ptsd for a while now. In 2013 I got a really bad panic anxiety attack and thought something was wrong with my heart. That year there were a lot of visits to the emergency room, hospitals and my doctor. They suspected something could be wrong with my heart, and had to have a 24h EKG a couple of times, and they did an ultrasound of my heart. Nothing turned up, and my heart was healthy. No one thought to suggest that it could be anxiety, so I went on with my life and it stopped for a while. Turns out I had a lot of minor anxiety attacks after this, and then it got really bad again in December last year. This was hands down my worst panic anxiety attack ever.

&#x200B;

Since then I went to a see a therapist. We found out that a lot of my anxiety attacks were because how my then stepmom treated me. She was verbally abusive all the time, and in some cases she was even physically abusive. This is were my PTSD stems from. I would for example get anxiety attacks if someone opened the door too fast (like she did, because that sound meant she was coming to scream at me). For a while I thought the root of my anxiety was her, cause I get really stressed if I think I'm doing something the wrong way etc. So I knew the PTSD and the fear of doing something the incorrect way was because of her, but I still felt something was missing. It didn't explain all of my anxiety.

&#x200B;

Recently I discovered that the root of my anxiety is my dad. That was when everything clicked in place. My mom said I have always been an anxious kid. The most annoying thing was that I always had to go to the bathroom no matter where we were and what we were doing (when my stresslevel is really high, I have to go to the bathroom really bad and often). 

My dad always put work before anything else. So from when I was around 4 years old, my dad would go to work before I usually woke up and come home late at night when I was asleep. If I wanted to see him, I had to wake up without an alarm clock or without my dad waking me up. I remember I always woke up in a panic and was really afraid that he was gone and would get out of my bed as fast as I could, run down the stairs and look out the window to see if his car was gone. If the car was gone, I would just cry hysterically for a really long time, and there was little my mom could do to calm me down. He was usually home on sundays but he didn't really spend much time with me.

When I was 6 up to 7 or 8 years old, before my parents slipt up, he would sometimes drive me to school and my siblings to kindergarden. I remember I just wanted to talk to him when he did this, but he was always on the phone the whole time and told us not to interrupt. I would often get so mad that I just walked away from him and walked to school myself. It took him a while to notice I was gone. If I didn't walk away, he would usually forget to drop me off at school (I was the last kid he would drop off), so he just drove right past it while on his phone. Then he would get mad at me for not reminding him that I was still in the car.

&#x200B;

When I was around 8 years old, my parents had split up and he was living by himself. We would spend time at his place every other weekend and every thursday. But those days were often cancelled because he had to work or just wanted to go out partying instead of spending time with us. When we were there, he was usually talking on his phone due to work, so we wouldn't really get to spend time with him. I would often get so mad that I ran away, and would often find a spot where I could see the road to see how long it would take before he noticed I was gone and went out looking for me. It usually took around an hour or two.  
Sometimes my dad would take us places, but it was usually because he was doing activities with his friends (often paintball), and we just had to sit and watch them play for a couple of hours, and then he was back on his phone.

&#x200B;

When I was 9, he got together with my then stepmom and quickly moved in with her and her two kids. Her kids always ruined our things, ran after us with swords or knives and just generally hurting us (her son for example broke my sister's arm and knocked out a tooth). Our then stepmom started to verbally abuse us pretty quickly and I told this to my dad several times. He refused to listen and just told me that I was exaggerating or that I just misunderstood the whole situation. I remember my mom eventually set up a meeting where my dad had to show up so that I could voice my concerns. He got really angry, said that he refused to listen to it and just stormed off. After this my dad told me I had to apologize to my then stepmom and needed to be nice to her. I had to live with them until I was 18 when I moved away. From I was 9 to 18 I tried several times to tell my dad how my then stepmom was but I was shut down as quickly as all the other times I did. In this time period I also tried to tell my grandmom (my father's mom) what was going on, but she too refused to listen. When I told my friends about the situation, or my boyfriends, they all said I was exaggerating and refused to believe me.  
In my teenage years I got pretty wild, and could pretty much do whatever I wanted without my dad questioning me why I was out all night or what I was doing. I could come home drunk and he wouldn't do much about it. I realize now that this was pretty much a cry for help and trying to get him to notice me.  
My then stepmom would also be verbally abusive right in front of him, and he would just ignore the situation and didn't do anything about it.  
I moved out when I was 18, but my then stepmom and my dad was my boss, so from 18 to 20 years old, I had to deal with her while I was on work (I needed the money).

&#x200B;

So I realize now where my insecurities come from and why I have anxiety and why I had the need to be noticed or acknowledged. Now I get a panick attack every time my stresslevel goes up and I can get a panick attack from pretty much anything, not just specific things.   
From 20 years old to now, 28 years old, he hasn't been good at reaching out, asking me how I'm doing and stuff like that. I rarely see him and I rarely speak with him. I realized all this for just a couple of days ago. I have now decided to cut him out of my life, based on something that happened this week. Last week he said he was coming to my town for a job meeting, and he made plans to go out to eat with me while he was in town. Two days before he was supposed to come to my town, I saw on snapchat that he and his family (his new girlfriend and their two kids) was traveling here. I didn't hear anything from him the first day they were in town, and I didn't hear anything from him the second day either. And then I saw on snapchat that they have gone home. I didn't hear a word from him. We had plan for the next day and I knew then that our plans would not happen (as usual. He often comes to my town for job meetings but never think to let me know, and the few times he does, he cancels on me). Then the day came, and I heard nothing. Today I got a message from him where he straight up lied to me, explaining that he hadn't traveled to my town and that the travel was cancelled because of the storm (the storm came in the afternoon the day we had plans, not the two whole days while he actually were in my town).

&#x200B;

I honestly feel really angry and disappointed at this moment. I've decided to cut him out of my life cause this is too toxic for me, and he doesn't respect me. I've also discovered that he has been talking trash about my fiancé, whom he has met briefly a few times. I've realized that after 28 years I'm just done trying to get my dad's attention and affection. I'm just done. And I realize that this means that I will probably lose contact with my grandmother, because she thinks my dad can do no wrong and refuses to listen if we tell her something she doesn't want to hear about him. This whole situation has driven my anxiety to go haywire.   
Sorry for the long post. I just had to get it out.  


Has anyone else been in a similar situation? I would love to hear it, or just general advice cause at the moment I feel like I'm being a huge asshole for doing this. Thanks.",2021-09-25 06:41:09

I see my dad having another heart attack. I see my husband dying while on a 911 call (he's a paramedic) or someone plowing into their ambulance. These thoughts are so vivid it makes me physically sick. I'll cry for so long. I worry constantly. I don't know how to push through this. 

If it matters in 29F. I do have depression, GAD and BPD. We think I have undiagnosed ADHD as well. I've been seeing the same therapist for years and she actually recommended I try to find a community on Reddit to find others who have the same fear and what helps them.

puw1mz,Fucking over everything,"I am fucking over everything... I am a college senior and the thought of graduating in May makes me cry. You see, I have a chaotic home life and the thought of having to move back into that chaos is so anxiety provoking. I have my dad who is emotionally volatile and any thing can set him off. Sucks to be around someone like that..never know when he is going to go off. I feel like there are so many expectations that come along with getting older and I still feel as though I am 19/20, even though I am 22. In some ways, I miss high school-I miss being young. I don't know...I just feel so mediocre compared to everyone else. Everyone around me has these crazy opportunities that come their way and I struggle even to reach out. Getting my current internship was such a challenge and I already fucked it up. There's a certain way that I want to execute myself and I'm pissed that I can't come across the way that I do in my mind. I can do so much more. Then, I hate being a friendless senior. It sucks. On one hand, it's my fault that I don't do more to stay in contact with people and consistently go to club meetings. Then its so stressful to hear people around me talk about post-grad life and they talk about in such a negative way. Yes, working is  fucking hard, but I feel like for me, I have to work... or else, I will just keep getting deeper in my anxiety. Plus, I don't even know what I want to do with my life...I feel so mediocre. Then on top of that, I have horrible body image issues and fucked up eating habits because I am very overweight and I'm short. So that fucking sucks. Then I feel like once you reach a certain age, people expect more from you. I am 22 and still live at home, only first had an internship and the remarks from people just make me feel like a fucking failure. I'm like 22 and people still think I'm in high school...how demoralizing when in just a couple of months I will be a college graduate. I used to see a fucking therapist but he was a complete asshole who made me feel like shit every time I left the appointment. I already carry so much shame and shit that he said didn't help. Each session he was like ""Oh you went to residential remember this..."". Bitch, that was fucking 3 years ago..I can barely remember what I did yesterday. Then this fucking asshole months ago implied that I wouldn't get my driver's license. I explained my situation to him over and over again and he still wasn't fucking grasping it. Well I passed anyways, so fuck him. His fucking remarks are the only reason why I passed because I wanted to prove this asshole wrong. Getting my driver's license was such a major accomplishment for me and his reaction was so subpar. I was so excited. Oh and then on top of that, I feel different from other people with anxiety disorders. Other people seem like they are still able to have friends, go to parties, network and do other shit. Well, I fucking struggle like there is no tomorrow with that. Now back to the asshole therapist, he fucking implied that I was a hermit and for weeks, he would badger me on dropping the sorority I was in. I fucking hated this sorority and was he the one paying for it? NOPE!!!!!!!!! pLUS it was so cliqueish and it ended up shutting down.

I want to find a new therapist but this process is so fucking annoying. I fucking hate going through the whole intake and shit. I thought about going back to my old therapist that I saw between the ages of 16-18.5, but ultimately decided against it because maybe I need a fresh start with a new therapist and I was a teen back then and I'm now an adult.",2021-09-25 06:05:32
puvwk8,Scared of not being able to help,"So I've been going to a therapist for some time now, and made a lot of improvements over the months, but now I'm scared that I won't the able to help someone.

I'm obsessed with making everything to help other, and people around me are starting to say that I'm diving in to deep into others people's problems by trying to pull everyone else up, but for me it just doesn't feel right not to do everything I can to help someone.

This is getting to the point where I start another anxiety medication ( now 4 in total) to keep myself together and not get absolute demolished by everything around me.

I was to drunk and high when someone needed me, and from there on i can't forgive myself and I've been doing everything I can to try to help, i can't sleep if my phone isn't on max volume, i feel like I'm always walking on eggs when around others to not cause trouble.

Everyone tells me that ""you aren't going to change the world"" and that I'm going in way to deep most of the times, but all of that goes against my beliefs and I keep jumping into wells to try to pull other people other people out of them.

I made a small mistake a few days ago and I lost 1.5kg in one day because of the stress that it caused me 

I don't know what do to from here, i know I will keep placing other people wellbeing in front of mine and I'm scared shitless that i will breakdown again and then not be able to help anyone and burden other people in the process.",2021-09-25 05:56:20

puvt0b,Is the white/ yellow cottage cheese sticky substance coming from my nose normal? (URGENT!!),Ok so I have a cold ( kinda nearing to end I think) and it was/is super bad with like chest heaviness and mucus in chest and coughs and sore throat and mucus in throat and bubble in nose and nasal drip and dizziness and a fever and runny nose and a stuffy nose etc etc all that stuff. and my right ear has been blocked for a couple days because of it I think (I can still hear but it’s lower) (maybe the other ear blocked too). With like a bit of whooshing sounds coming every now and then (like wind blowing. So today i was blowing my nose because my nose has been feeling STUFFYYY for days like I got the cold on Monday/late weekend and now it’s Friday and my nose has been feeling so full and every time I blow there’s like a bubble in there and I blow it back up and it goes in my throat and I swallow and I choke and so on. But 24/7 it feels like there’s a build up of snot and congestion and my throat sounds so nasally 24/7 it’s so hard to breathe from my nose so I was blowing and blowing and it’s so hard to get the snot out like when it did come out it was yellow and white and sticky and looked like cottage cheese and in my nose it had kinda a blue tinge but then I blew it out and it was either yellow or white and it was so sticky and thick. And i kept on blowing and blowing and more kept on coming it was so hard to get out idk if this is like build up  for days or something else I need to get checked out cos this carried on for like a full 10 or 20 minutes and u still feel bubbles in my nose EVERYTIME I breathe and stuff and it feels full. So is this all normal? Is this part of the cold? I also coughed up like yellow mucus too a couple times. I’ve also been rubbing my nose so much there’s like a red bump at the opening inside my nose lol. Will this all go away soon or a sign of something more serious like an ear infection or something else I need to get treated? Also every time I breathe I can feel the bubbles in my nose u know what I mean?,2021-09-25 05:49:49

puviv1,I'm uncomfortable in my apartment,"Ever since I moved into my apartment, I have felt uncomfortable. The energy just does not seem right, and I have troubles sleeping. I have tried to decorate my place. I also have many house plants.

Other info: I work from home, and my window faces east but does not get direct sunlight 9 months out of the year.

My apartment is a studio where each ""room"" has an arched open doorway wall separating the three ""rooms"". The arched doorway is as large as 60in wide.

If you walk in thru my front door from the hallway, you are in my office with the kitchen on your left and bedroom on your right. 
Standard kitchen, really, with a furnace in it. my office and dining room (desk, eating table, book case) are the same function. My bedroom also serves as my living room (tv, couch, and closet on one side, bed on the other. 

I struggle to feel at peace, I struggle falling asleep/staying asleep/waking up.

When I sleep in my childhood bedroom at my parents, most of these issues subside.

puvcrf,Does anyone ever get anxious when they see a friend post online,Hi I’m new to this subreddit and am currently dealing with anxiety from the loss of my father in December of 2020. After my father passed away in December of 2020 I had been doing well I never felt anxious about anything really but after I got a new job in August where I’ve been more isolated I’ve had multiple breakdowns where I relive the night when my father died. I brought it up with a female friend and my girlfriend. After that it felt good to finally let people know what I was going through and it was the first step for me to get help. But now whenever I see my female friend post anything online I get extremely anxious and feel trapped. My mind has associated seeing her with my anxiety and it seems to be getting worse. I am going to bring this up with my counselor next week and see what he thinks i should do but I think cutting contact for with her for awhile might be the best solution. Please let me know if anyone else has had this and what they did to help it.,2021-09-25 05:20:22

I've ALWAYS been an A student, my entire life. Now im a senior in HS. So I started taking classes at community college in the mornings, I take three classes there per semester, psychology, public speaking, and personal finance. God they are so hard I have B's in two of them and a C in one and its stressing me out so much when my parents find out theyre going to go insane and im so worried

I also work as a freelancer so i have to write around 10k words in research writing/marketing a week, and i ALSO have highschool full time, and ALSO i got hired at the grocery store and im going to be working 16 hours a week starting next week and I love that im doing all this cause i need money but it is absolutely at the expense of my grades and im caring more about making money than good grades now. Honestly, i dont care about school at all anymore. Which is a feeling ive never felt because ive always been so worried about it. Now i cant bring myself to try cause it seems useless anyways. grades are dumb, but then seeing that i have bad grades is worrying me so much and idk what to do

I think im going to use it as a motivator to try realy hard on my next few assignments and bump up my grades for all those classes, but still, im really stressed out about it and i had to rant lol",2021-09-25 05:19:28

A few months ago, I got prescribed 10mg propranolol on as take as I need basis. So I'm still pretty new to this.

Just looking for some advice in regards to drinking. I am going clubbing soon and am a little nervous about the amount of people so thinking about taking some prop first. I am going to be drinking so wondering about people experiences. I have quite a high tolerance (whole bottle of (cheap) wine without getting tipsy).

People who have drank on propranolol, how much does it affect you? Does it make it stronger? Make you more nauseous? More hungover? 

Basically should I try it or just get very drunk to beat the anxiety haha

puuxof,Does anyone else get bursts of energy where they can power through a bunch of “scary” things at once?,"My anxiety has gotten better over the years, but I still let “scary” things pile up and then get more anxious about them the more I let them build (y’all know how it is!) But, once in a while, I will get a burst of confidence and knock five things off my scary list at once. For example, the other day I set up a doctors appointment, resolved something with my pharmacy, submitted a maintenance ticket, got an estimate for a car repair, opened an email I had been avoiding, and dug into an intimidating project at work. That’s more than I can typically handle in a month. Does anyone else get this? Is there a way to harness the power?",2021-09-25 04:53:39

I’m on week three of Lexapro but all it seems to have done so far is make me not cry.

Is there anywhere I can go? I have been trying to see a psychiatrist but I can’t seem to get into see one. Even if I do I know that it will take a while for whatever they do to work.

puuw13,Klonopin .25 mg ODT is a hit or miss.,"Yeah it's a low dose, 1x per day as needed with 15 allotted to me each month. With my history, I should be thankful I have any. I've had 4-5 occasions where it actually worked and I could feel something, but every other time I felt nothing. On a particularly bad night I did something I shouldn't have and took 4 at once (1mg). Absolutely nothing. Anyone else experience this? I want to try another low dose of a different benzo but I'm nervous to ask because of my history. Those of you who have experienced this, did other benzos work better? Which ones did you have success with? Or perhaps even something else like gabapentin, or god forbid, Lyrica (in my dreams). From what I understand gabapentin is well tolerated and while still being abusable isn't really comparable to benzos for most people

EDIT: for more information my general anxiety hasn't been a huge issue since I've started paxil but it hasn't affected my panic attacks at all which is what eventually led me to being put on Klonopin in the first place after some hospitalizations and long periods of insomnia",2021-09-25 04:50:56

i know i shouldn't be this depressed or discouraged about it (people get rejected for these things all the time), but to me, this meant a lot to me. this was my first time doing this job stuff outside of school, and it just feels so discouraging that i'm not good at talking, and im assuming that's what made them not like me at the interview...

One last step though. 

My therapist told me to get on a dating app and meet up with women. (Because they’re kind of the ultimate thing that stresses me.) 

I get along fine with girls and I know some find me attractive, it’s just, until now shyness made dating impossible. Add My fear of intimacy in the mix of and here I am a 23 year old virgin.

But let’s forget about sex, for now. I should focus on dating and having a good time. The rest will come.

putz0g,Therapist of only ONE session has caused me a lot of anxiety and suicidal thoughts. Messages below.,"Context: I became very sick yesterday with a cough/cold. I slept most the day and the other half I spent worrying about work and money if I had 10 days off with COVID isolation (I'm on 0hr). I forgot to text him about my symtoms for my 2nd session today. I know that's my fault! I realised at 8am and had a mini panic and texted him. With me being sick/half daze/panic, and because I'm also used to NHS services, it just didn't click with me he'd have to take me off the wait list as he can only have a certain number of patients. 

I'm so embarrassed and guilty that not only did I forget to text him, but I feel that he thinks I have only apologised to get my own way (back on his wait list). To be fair, I don't actually remember signing a contract, and he didn't tell me about his policies in the first session. 

I would have been fine to pay the fee for this session if he asked me, or even if he explained to me that I needed to be taken off his list for now as it was late notice. But he didn't really explain what his policies are, he just kind of did it leaving me confused.

My anxiety is sky high, I feel an enormous amount of guilt and I don't want to be on this shitty planet any more. I also feel annoyed that he went from 0 to 100 and wasn't softer about his approach. 

Oh he also called me poor in the first session... ""oh you're a support worker, you're poor"" which was meant as a joke but I was still a bit like 😬. He offered me £5 off £95 in which I was equally appreciative and insulated.

Now I just hate myself for not looking at the red flags, for letting him know about not being able to attend too late, not understanding the fact I have been taking off his client list, and the way I've allowed this to affect me so much. 




ME: Hi. Unfortunately I have covid symptoms so won't be able to make it in today. Can we rearrange once my PCR test is back please?


HIM: Hi, I’ll offer today’s appointment to those waiting. Please get in touch when you don’t have symptoms.


ME: Hiya, PCR came back negative. I still have symptoms of a cold but feeling ok. It's up to you whether i should come in. I'm available Wednesday 29th or Thursday 30th next week or Monday 4th or Thursday 7th the week after. If not, I will message you when my symptoms have completely gone 🙂

HIM: Hi, I’ll contact you when I have availability as I’ve had to offer your space to someone on the waiting list.

ME: Ah ok, no problem!

ME: I'm sorry I'm a bit confused after rereading, has my entire spot on your list been replaced? Sorry I don't mean to be rude I'm just confused!

HIM: Hi, sadly - I can’t keep future appointments open when someone is unable to say when they can/ can’t see me. As was our case. 

So someone had the session you and I had booked. 

At 2.20 they asked for a sesssion next Friday. As I didn’t have anything back from you I said yes. I wasn’t expecting you to notice Covid symptoms and get a PCR test all within a 6 hour timeframe to be honest. 

So they were able to start therapy at 2.20pm today. You weren’t - to the best of my knowledge, at 2.20pm able to start.  So yes, this person has taken the available session space. I hope this clarifies.

ME: I'm so sorry it was such short notice - I was so poorly yesterday  afternoon I just slept.

I'm just a little confused as to why I can't book another session?  If someone replaces one of my sessions (which was obviously fair enough), do they replace my spot on your client list? Sorry I hate to ask

HIM: Hi, who is the greatest of respect. If you knew you couldn’t attend a session yesterday because you’re so poorly and had Covid symptoms, it would’ve been very helpful for me to have known that yesterday.

ME: No I know I am really sorry. I got ill quite quick and was asleep from 4pm - midnight. It just slipped my mind at midnight too with me still feeling very under the weather.

HIM: Hi, I run a small business I  that employs three people. It is important that I maximise the sessions that are available. Despite the late notice, I offered your appointment to somebody else today and they were able to make it. At 2:20 pm I had two patients who I had assessed - yourself and this patient who were both wanting therapy. This patient was able to start. You were not, at that moment. So the appointment slot has gone to this patient.

ME: I understand that. I'm not expecting for you to prioritise my appointment over anothers, I appreciate it was late notice. When I have had counselling before, a sickness meant the appointment was rearranged. I am unsure of how you work especially in the private sector but wanted to clarity if it was the same. I may have misinterpreted and thought I was taken off your list completely. I'm not trying to be rude I just wanted clarification, sorry",2021-09-25 03:54:40
puttbd,i think i know a reason behind some of my issues,"okay so first i’ll start with like a few tws

Medical
Doctors 
Mention of Consent being done for me



i’m gonna try and keep this as vague as possible

so like when i was younger i had a lot of stomach issues TMI stuff, and i had something done that my mum consented too for me (i think i was too young tok consent myself) but ever since then i run from doctors if they try to touch me, specifically near my stomach/below area, becahse i was terrified it was gonna happen again, and i have no idea how to tell anyone how much it traumatised me?

because it was consensual i have no reason to feel this uncomfortable/grossed out about it but no one knows why i have so much fear around people/doctors

i think it was also because it was a male doctor and i’m AFAB, (assigned female at birth) and it was very medical and stuff but it literally traumatised me",2021-09-25 03:45:32

put4na,Tips on slowing down eating,"I wake up, suck down breakfast because I have to run for the bus. At work, I pretty much have to suck down my food between phone calls. No real break for lunch, so it's get it in while I can. I tried not eating at work, but yeah that doesn't work well when working 12-16 hours. When I get home, well it's bedtime, no time for food.

Fine. The problem is, that carries over to when I'm off. I just always feel rushed eating, because I normally have no time to do so. I'm not severely overweight, and I don't feel hungry when I'm done because I ate too fast, but I find I just don't enjoy it (which IMO sucks more than being hungry after). I prepare my food, put extra care into it being it's my day off, just to find at the end of the meal... all that work I did and I don't even remember tasting it. Tonight for example, a nicely seasoned steak, and chomp chomp gone. Honestly more than half of my meal I can say I don't remember what it tastes like.

I can maybe slow down for one or two bites, say ""hey, this tastes great, now keep it up..."" and before I know it, done. ""Hey... how did that taste? Ummm... dunno, really.""

I've tried putting down the utensils, water, smaller bites, none of that stuff seems to work for more than a few bites. Each time I sit down, I try, and the result is the same.

In the end, it kind of causes a little additional anxiety because I realized I didn't take the time to enjoy when I should have.

puse2r,should think about medication?,"hi I'm 18 years old. I have not been diagnosed with a mental disorder or condition. I've had an autism spectrum test a few months ago, and the results showed that I do not have autism but some signs, which are most likely caused by anxiety because they get worse when I feel anxious and less worse when i feel relaxed.

i have had CBT for 1 full year when I was 13 until I was 14, this was also the year when my anxiety really started and made me unable to go to school for 1 year after that year full of CBT and other help I went to a different school without going to therapy or a psychologist, but I still had soms anxiety attacks now and then. 

last year I went to therapy again because I had 1 month where I had several anxiety attacks and felt depressed. I had CBT and EMDR which both did not help me at all so I stopped after around 8 months. I still have a lot of physical problems which change overtime because of my anxiety: I get palpitations at least 3 times a day, stomach aches, cheek biting and the worst one: I sleep poorly which causes a lack of energy and a bad attention span.

the physical symptoms are the ones that really affect my daily life and  I want to change that. But I don't want to go to therapy again, this because I don't think it will have a positive effect on me. I already know how to behave in certain situations, but I can't do it. should I talk about medication with my gp or are there any other options you'd recommend?

note: I have had passive suicidal thoughts in the last month and I do not have any allergies if that matters

I'm quite tired while typing this so do not mind my grammar and spelling mistakes please, thank you!

I'm in a relationship and  my girlfriend can tell how anxious I am all the time and my anxiety rubs off on her and I don't want that to happen.

purene,Thoughts on journaling to help with anxiety - what is your experience?,"I’ve always had bouts of anxiety throughout my adult life, and I never understood what triggered them and why. At the time, I felt a bit lost in what to do about it or even how to understand it. A friend suggested that I start journaling daily to recognize the times that would trigger feelings of anxiousness. 

Using a journal helped me to create a clear structure for working on my anxiety and stress management. I like to think of it as a personal trainer for my brain! Just a trainer would encourage you to complete those extra push-ups, a journal can encourage you to make mindfulness exercises a daily habit and works as a visual reminder. 

My personal findings were that I seemed to get anxious when either a large social or work occasion would occur. The day before the occasion, and the day of the occasion, I would note in my journal of feeling stressed, overwhelmed, and in some cases trying to avoid attending the event altogether. 

I still use a journal today, but only write down a few short words at the start of each day to express how I’m feeling (e.g. Excited, nervous, challenged) - I might add additional sentences on these feelings. This forms part of my daily check-in. For the rest of the daily page, I include my daily tasks and appointments. For me, this makes it much easier to stick to daily journaling.

While a journal for myself worked as a tool to help with my anxiety, it may not work for everyone. A journal can’t replace therapy or advice from a professional, but it can form part of a positive daily habit to help understand yourself better and to boost your well-being.

I’d be interested to know if anyone else has experience of using a journal for anxiety, and any tips that you might have.",2021-09-25 01:30:55

Since I was a kid I would subconsciously keep track of all the people around me.  Just like 4 people in the house, I would know where they were at all times.  

Then I remember working on my first restaurant.  We went in early in the morning and there were like 3-4 of us prepping.  Again I would subconsciously keep track of everyone’s whereabouts.  

I just thought of this and I’m not sure if it derives from anxiety, trauma, or adhd.  Maybe none of the above.  But I also tend to just be a people watcher.  If I have to go to a waiting room or something alone I cannot be looking at my phone.  I usually sit in the corner away from the door and just watch people like a fly on the wall, going about their day.

It's not a constant headache, but the tightness I feel is constant, sometimes it's a bit better, sometimes a bit worse. Neck pain is a bit worse than the headache in the last few days and it's been going on for 14 days now. It's making me depressed and anxious.

puq5cy,Hyperventilation could cause your anxiety,"In short: Hyperventilating can result in anxiety and depression

About 6 months ago, I had a panick attack. Rapid heart beating, thought I was dying. With that I also developed weird tingly sensations. One evening they became so bad i thought again I was going to die, went to the hospital, they did a blood test and BOOM my blood was extremely alcalic. They told me to slow my breathing and said I was hyperventilating. From there on every time I catched my self breathing too fast, i slowed down. And from there on no anxiety attacks anymore.
4 days ago after a heavy workout (fast breathing - hyperventilating) i started having extreme anxiety, weird existential angst and the most extreme derealization I've ever experienced, it was hell (almost). This hell continued until I remembered: BREATHING. I started controlling my breath again and BOOM no anxiety anymore.

Today, at school I had a bad anxiety attack for not much reason, I just had so much background stress that one tiny thing was enough to send into deep shit. 

Anyway, I honestly feel like I'm a week away from a nervous breakdown which sounds like an overreaction since im legit not even 17.
I think it's time I go back to therapy, even though i hated it so much last time and it stressed me out too much. 
I think my perception of therapy has changed because before it was more for suspected depression and I was expecting a quick fix, but now, I'm not expecting a fix, I just wanna talk through my stress to someone that isnt my family or friends because it's not healthy.


So yeah, I'm thinking about asking my doctor about stuff, even tho I'm scared that shes gonna just say, did u call the other therapist I suggested? Cuz I didnt n I think I lost the number.
Idk, I'm still really scared about it and I dont want to add something to stress about.

puprnt,I've been hiding a double life from my family and friends for 8 years.," 

I've been hiding the fact that i've been unemployed and living with my parents from my friends, and the rest of my family for the last 8 years. The only people that know the truth are my parents, my 2 siblings and their respective partners.

I've been depressed and anxious since I dropped out of University in 2013. I have been diagnosed with moderate depression and have been on and off of SSRIs, they helped with my general mood and make the days where I have to force myself back to sleep over and over because I don't want to be alive come less frequently. But they didn't fix my problems on their own so I gave up on them.

I get anxiety attacks if I have to leave my comfort zone at all, I'll start sweating and my stomach will tie in knots if I have to go to the bank or the post office or anything, and I'll talk myself out of going. This has prevented me from working, my parents ran a cafe and tried to get me to come in and start working from a comfortable place, before they sold it recently. I tried countless times to get up and go in, on the days where they really need my help and practically beg me to come in and help, and on days where nobody knows I'm planning on going.

Over the past 8 years I've managed to show up maybe 10 times, each time I get my and my parents' hopes up that maybe this was the step I needed to get me out of my rut, and the next day I dissapoint everyone and cant come in.

The shame and disappointment in myself after makes me want to hide away from everyone, my parents especially, which is very difficult when I live in the same house as them. So when I wake up in the morning I force myself to sleep again over and over until well past midnight when I'm sure everybody is asleep in the house. Only then do I emerge from my room, eat the dinner that was left for me in the kitchen, sit on the computer all night and go to bed before everybody gets home from work. I can keep this up for weeks at a time, living with an upside down sleep schedule to avoid everyone.

That's what my parents and siblings know my life to be, my friends don't know any of this though. They think I \*do\* work with my parents, and most nights I'll play video games with them and talk over Discord. Maybe one night every couple of months I'll even manage to go out with them, if I don't have an anxiety attack beforehand and make up some bullshit excuse.

When I was on Sertraline it improved my general mood, but my day to day was still just waking up in the morning, spending hours on Reddit/Youtube/Video Games until I ""get home from work"", at which point I would change all of my accounts from ""Appear Offline"" to ""Online"" and carry on until I go to sleep, then repeat the day. The real problem was still there, so I gave up on the SSRIs.

I've tried councilling a few times, each time paid for by my parents, and every time I go to the first few sessions, then wake up anxious about the session and force myself to sleep through the day and miss the next session. I never end up going back.

I feel like I've gotten too good at avoiding the shame I should be feeling for living my life like this.

As far as everyone else knows I'm a normal person living a normal life, when really, I've spent the last 8 years in my parent's house, leeching off of them. They think I'm a regular person, when really I'm a parasite and everybody's life would be better if I never existed.

I don't know if I can keep up this lie, I don't know if I should keep up this lie

I don't know what to do with myself. I don't know how to pull myself out of this hole I've dug, I don't know how to start living a normal life, I don't think I can start living a normal life. Everything would be better if one day when I force myself back to sleep I don't wake up again, and everyone can eventually be happy that this parasite on my family is gone.",2021-09-25 00:02:47

puoam6,I'm so sick and tired of anxieties curse on my family.,"You can trace its genesis back to my grandad on my dad's side.

At 15 he was captured by the nazis in Poland, put in a death camp and saw 32 of his family die, yet he survived by some miracle. You just cannot imagine living through that hell. He never talked of it, except when drunk he would ramble about the Germans and gas Chambers. He was always drunk, but he was a lovely man, I think I'd drink everyday to block that shit out. But that's where it started, my grandad self medicating in a time where mental health help was none existent. Now I've worked in mental health for 20 years, I know a doctor would diagnose him with ptsd, anxiety, depression and a whole lot more.

Next in line was my dad. Psychotic, crippled by anxiety, he has spent the last 30 years on numerous medications, reclusive, forever out of reach, anothee victim of mental health crisis in my family.

Then it's me next. To say I fight is an understatement, I've fought for the last 25 years to not give in to anxiety, it's exhausting, I'm tired, and some days it's just like going back to square one. But I've worked my ass off in mental health services for teenagers. I've worked in adult mental health services. I get up, I show up, a single dad with two girls, I present a confident front, when inside I am in a constant war. I have days I win, days when anxiety wins, but I refuse to stop fighting..

Then this week my youngest daughter has had a serious mental health breakdown and its awful to see her wrecked by anxiety too. I feel guilty. Like something in my genes I've passed on to her. And I hate that

pundu9,A hope I’ve never known before,"Look into rerouting your neural connectivity. Look up videos and articles. It has shown me a hope for fixing my anxious brain for good. 

Basically, yes, if you are a part of this sub then your brain is fucked just like mine... BUT! Turns out brain chemistry can be changed through very simple but specified and consistant activities. The activities are not complex. They are all really simple and ones everyone has done at some point. 

We can train our brain just like we train our bodies. We can train our brain to take the path of gratitude or calmness instead of anxiety. Right now our brains are wired to protect us, to survive, to fear everything. We can rewire them though. We are actually 100% capable of doing that. Practically and scientifically its been proven. 

Right now all I have is hope because I just started this journey but I will keep you posted.

pum8cl,Being highly anxious makes me talk to myself,"In the past year I’ve noticed that I talk to myself out loud when I’m really anxious or mad at myself. It’s very critical talk to myself, usually my inner thoughts that are worded as if I’m saying it to somebody else. The most common one is finding myself saying “stupid fucking bitch” “you’re such a bitch” over and over again quietly, or loudly depending how mad I am. I notice my thoughts are racing as I’m talking to myself, so I don’t even realize I’m saying it out loud. This is usually all when I’m alone, but more and more I find myself doing it at work or at the store. 
It’s embarrassing, I’m well kept and care more than I should about what people think of me… so whispering to myself “stupid fucking bitch” over and over without realizing it makes me seem pretty insane.

pulxqz,My anxiety is ruining my marriage,"First time posting, though I’ve been reading for a while.  I just don’t know what else to do.  As I said in the title, my anxiety is ruining my marriage. 

I’ve struggled with anxiety for a long time, but it was always manageable.  It has been over different things all throughout my life…. It would manifest itself for a while, I’d struggle with it and it would go away.  In general my wife would be good with it.  She understood it was just me and who I was and we’d get through it.  However, the last year has happened.  

I was laid off from my job during COVID.  I really didn’t think that’d bothered me like it did.  It took awhile but I eventually found a job.  Not a great one, not in my field exactly, but it was good pay and benefits.  Almost immediately I was scared to death to go to work.  Throughout the day I would fear any error I made, any feedback I received, any drip in performance.  I felt my boss was over bearing…. Any time he called me to his office or sent me a email I would freeze. I began throwing up in the mornings before work and crying to my wife that I didn’t want to go.  On my days off I would sleep constantly because I was so exhausted from just surfing the day. I began seeing a therapist regularly.  I just knew it was not the right job for me and I needed to leave.  

So I found a new job.  More in my field, more what I did before getting laid off and with a company known for having a work/life balance.  Problem solved?  Wrong…. It is worse.  

Daily panic attacks, throwing up daily before work, fits of crying where I need to leave the building so no one sees me. I struggle to sleep at night…. Usually I wake up around 3am and sweat in bed while I watch the clock.  On top of all this I’m soooooo depressed now because nothing is better I feel so helpless.  

But the worst part of all this is the impact to my family.  My wife is loving and kind.  She wakes up with me to help me get ready for work so I can have time to do breathing exercises, she takes my calls and texts when I need someone, but lately it is becoming too much for her.  She has her own problems too.  She has the kids to worry about and her own life.  She is to the point she needs me to be better and all I’m doing is getting worse.  

She said to me in an argument recently that she doesn’t believe I’m trying hard enough.   I explain all the things I’m doing and how hard it is just to do those (going to psychiatrist now, breathing exercises, journaling, signed up for stress coaching, etc).  I just think she sees things only getting worse so believes I need to do more or something different.  She doesn’t understand how the smallest things are so hard.  I have to pep myself up just to get out of bed and shower.  

I love my wife and I know she loves me, but we are in a bad place where my anxiety is controlling my life and has been for long enough where it is too much for her.  We asked the question today if Maybe it would be better if we weren’t together but I can’t see how that fixes anything and really would only make things worse.  

I really don’t know what to do anymore.  Even if things go fine for a day or two, work still comes next Monday and this whole vicious cycle repeats.",2021-09-24 20:47:13

So I had this snapchat account where I talked to people I didn’t know irl (sometimes on an intimate level). And some intimate pictures of me are saved on there. But a couple of months ago I lost the password and I can not recover it. Snapchat customer support hasn’t been helping either.

Since then I haven’t spent a second not thinking about what could happen if the account gets hacked. I know it is out of my control, I just can’t stop thinking about it and it is ruining my day to day life.

The password is unguessable, and the email adress connected to it has a very high chance of not even existing (I filled in like 10-12 random letters). So the likelihood of something happening to it is very low. But I still can’t let it go.

Does anybody have any tips on how I can just enjoy life, without being worried all the time? 

Thank you in advance everyone!",2021-09-24 20:41:30

puj11k,"Do I Have OCD, Or OCD Tendencies?","Before I say anything im definitely going to get myself referred for evaluation on this. It's a strange one because of another component. Im an alcoholic. I guess ill just run through the story quickly. I was hospitalised in January due to withdrawal trying to quit and it was quite traumatic. I spent five days there in sheer panic and anxiety but I was safe. When I was released this us were things started to get a little, off. Before bed. I would start doing things in threes. Pull the handle of my door to make sure it was locked three times, rubbed my Witcher medallion I have over my mirror three times, then for some reason lightly tapped my chest three times. And I would pull on my e-cig three times during the day, other times not. It always thought of it as good luck. I did this for about two-three months until one night I thought why the fuck am I doing this? And it stopped, I stopped thinking about it. And that was that. Until I started drinking again and had withdrawal (not as bad, cut the relapse short). Now im three weeks sober, this night time ritual of threes is happening again like the last time.  Also, this threes thing never happened before the start of this year and I've not always been an alcoholic so I have no clue where it came from. And it's only this night time thing and my e-cig that I can think of so it doesn't really interfere in my life. But it does worry me. 

Other information I guess is that I like things neat. But it doesn't bother me too much if it's not. Mildly sometimes. It's more stuff I can see. If it's in a drawer if it's packed away folded that's enough. Shut and done. But stuff on my cabinet is quite neat and lined up. Id probably move stuff it it weren't but this would literally be maybe five minutes tops a day. You wouldn't look at my room and think this guy's got OCD, you'd probably just think he's tidy. Im not overly clean (I am hygienic though like my room or me doesn't stink hah) but neat. If that makes sense.

So yeah, what do you guys think?",2021-09-24 18:18:11

puid50,Does anxiety cause these pains/night sweats?,"(24,F) I randomly started having deep lower right back pain in one spot that kept worsening while sitting in a car. Then a week later, my pain started to radiate to my bumcheeks and tailbone and started to waking up in the middle of the night with night sweats. A week again later, I now feel constant urge to pee(random sharp pains in vagina) and poop and pain in both lower sides of back and lower legs ache. The pain just continued to raise my anxiety which I think is making my pain worse.

 I had a sports massage a couple days ago and the massage guy told me my pelvis was out of alignment and realigned me and gave me a remedial massage. Not sure if that’s helped because I’m still having pain in my lower back and buttocks.

I have been referred to see a general physician but the wait is long and can’t help but worry if it could be something worse. Could it be something as simple as torn/strained muscle? Can torn muscles happen out of nowhere? Does it take this long to recover from them? The only lifting I’ve been doing is picking up my 1yr old nephew. Worried about every new symptom that comes..

puhx2v,People won't quit touching me and standing too close.,"I work in construction. As you can probably imagine, it's not the ideal work environment for someone with anxiety, but I tolerate the stressful conditions because it pays very well. My anxienty developed after joining my trade and I'm working on transitioning into an office job. One reason is these men won't stop putting their hands on me.

Construction workers are some of the most childish, inconsiderate bullies I've ever worked with. They horseplay often and many of them invade my personal space daily. It drives me nuts when someone comes up behind me and grabs me by the shoulders, or pats me on the back. Many of the older men are close talkers. I have to back away from them like 10 times during a conversation but they keep scooting closer. What the hell happened to social distancing? 

I'm a non-confrontational person. I feel like if I correct these people and tell them what they do bothers me, they will think I don't like them or be offended. Many of these guys are like brothers to me. I feel like I have to print a t-shirt that says ""don't fucking touch me"" on it.

puhdct,Three-way with Anxiety,"Hi there,

I'm having real trouble dealing with my very anxious girlfriend at the moment, I wonder if you guys could share some insight? Particularly if you have ever made a relationship work where one partner has anxiety and the other is the complete opposite. Our context is below:

My girlfriend is a successful, smart, beautiful 27yo woman with a high-octane job. Her non-anxiety-driven personality is just amazing to be around. She can be so supportive, kind, and thoughtful to me and my family too. But, her anxiety has become a constant theme, and her defence mechanisms can be so unpleasant (dismissive/cynical/rude behaviour). I try to support her by encouraging her to take a more positive approach, which works for me, but she tends to resist this and arguably it makes it worse. I have gently encouraged her to seek therapy for three years, she decided to start around six months ago and she is definitely putting in the effort. Still, I would say one in every two evenings ends with her employing one of the above defence mechanisms or crying because 'everything is her fault'. I think she's frustrated that her anxiety isn't 'fixed' yet despite six months of therapy, which just adds more to the background level of anxiety.

I'm a confident 28yo man. I struggled with dark depression in my late teens/early twenties, so I have a huge amount of respect for mental health issues, but I've personally been in a stable place for several years. My always-on coping mechanism is to maintain a growth mindset and positive attitude. I have personally benefited from years of therapy, which has really developed my own empathy as well as making me an advocate for therapy for others. I'm comfortable being honest about what I want, saying what I mean, and apologising when I get things wrong. I sometimes look back at my diaries from that dark period as proof that things can change and it gives me hope. I just want to live a life where my girlfriend and I are happy together.

She sometimes raises the subject of marriage and kids - I want both of those things, but I can't imagine building a home with this kind of instability. My parents divorced terribly and hate each other, so if I could do one thing in my life it would be to build a happy home for my future kids. At the back of my mind, I wonder if we will ever get to a place where the life we both want is possible. I also wonder whether I'm helping her or making her anxiety worse.

What I'd really like to know is, how can we go back to loving spending time together when my positivity makes her feel inadequate and her negativity brings me down? Have you done anything in a similar situation that made it better? I'm just seeking information and I have a thick skin, so feel free to constructively criticise. I'm also happy to give some examples/more detail if it's helpful.

Thanks very much.",2021-09-24 16:30:05
puhbxt,Weird Intrusive Thoughts,"Hey everyone, so I’m a 22year old male and I recently in the last 2 months had a random panic attack/anxiety event and since then I’ve been on medicine and things and I’m going to therapy and things have been pretty good since starting my new medication. Not a ton of anxiety, like it’s very manageable compared to what it was a month ago. Anyways I feel relatively ok, other than the insane amount of intrusive thoughts/worry that I’m having. Like I question everything I do and everything in my life. Like just for example, I’ve been with my girlfriend for 5 and half years and everything is great, she’s great but I find myself asking questions like “should I enjoy being with her this much?” “What if I get not ok and it ruins my relationship?” “Should I just leave so I don’t bother her with my anxiety?” And none of these things I want at all. I love my relationship. And another example I could be watching my favorite show or playing my favorite game and then I question why I’m playing it if I should be playing or is it ok to be sitting inside playing? 

Sorry if this isn’t actually anxiety related but I’m just curious if this is normal or anyone else has anything like this happen. Thank you.",2021-09-24 16:27:12

For this past month (and the next 5) im studying in another country and it has been a really amazing experience. Ive done a lot of new things, met a lot of new people and I now have a group of friends (weird and new for me, for sure).

The problem is: my mental health is getting shittier everyday in here. Ive been having panic and anxiety attacks often, ive been really doubting my worth in the world and my self esteem is basically inexistent at this point.

I dont have a room to myself in here, so my mental shit always leads me to cry in the street at night, but its like 2 degrees now and it will only get colder. All this new group of friends (who i constantly doubt even like me) think im crazy because basically all of them have seen me mid-crisis crying over basically nothing.

I dont want to go home and I really like it here, the experience has been great. But my fucking brain putting me down everyday is so bad and i dont know how it will be in 5 more months, it sucks",2021-09-24 16:08:17
puh19t,Noticing that I have anxiety/OCD,"I recently noticed that I've probably had some form of anxiety / OCD for a while, although I've not been diagnosed. I didn't realise it before because I used to always blame it on something else or just assumed it's something everyone else experiences.

For example, I used to cry a lot and journal repetitively about my family and life, I had no motivation and felt like a failure. I would ruminate over stuff I said and want to bring it up again but be scared of bringing it up again so I just spent hours writing about the same things over and over again. I would drop everything I do to wait for someone to text me back. I had a bad first relationship and just could not stop thinking and talking about it. When I had problems, I didn't come up with any solutions, even temporary ones like ""ok relax put it into perspective and worry about it later"". It was always ""my problems are ruining my life!"" x 100.

Apart from ruminating, I also used to spend up to 10 minutes just checking the stuff in my room again and again before leaving. My family thought this was weird but I thought it was normal. I do this less now but I still second-guess myself when it comes to turning off a tap, even though I've never left a tap running in my life.

However sometimes I would have irregular bursts of energy and happiness and forget about my periods of anxiety. Recently I've also noticed that I can change my perspective on things pretty quickly; sometimes I get paralysed by certain things, and sometimes I just compartmentalise it in my head and realise it's not a big deal.

pugq44,Getting over intrusive thoughts but obsessive about explaining them,"I barely get intrusive thoughts now (probably 10 a day or so, and often it's just remembering thoughts I've had before) but I've tried to explain my thoughts to someone else recently and now I sometimes read over my texts or think about what I said. For the last week I thought my explanation was mostly ok; I could explain them further but I didn't need to. I thought I could just focus on just moving on. It was wonderful to actually relax and be in control of myself for a while.

but last night I looked at some of my intrusive thoughts explanations again and thought about all the ways I could have been misunderstood, then I suddenly had no energy for 2 hours and cried because I really wanted to explain my thoughts again but I was scared.

My logic is that if that person thinks my thoughts aren't that bad, then getting worse thoughts means I have to explain that my thoughts can be worse. Therefore it's best if I don't get worse thoughts so that I wouldn't have to explain them. Then if I get a thought I would analyse it and feel bad if it's worse.

I know that person doesn't care about my thoughts and finds my explanations unnecessary and annoying but at this point it's a hole I've dug myself into since I already talked about my thoughts with him.",2021-09-24 15:41:42

pugops,"22(M), Didn't know I had anxiety until Covid started in 2020. Lost a loved one","Hey everyone, so I didn't know I had anxiety up until last year when my aunt died due to covid. After that it was just a downward spiral and I didn't know what was wrong with me. Given from where I live, folks don't really have alot of awareness about mental health problems. My symptoms are as follows:

1. Chest muscle twitches and general restlessness
2. Heart beats faster
3. When it starts getting dark outside, I kinda feel anxious too
4. Some lightheadedness and vertigo
5. Can't go to sleep sometimes and then my thoughts act as a rabbit hole to another attack
6. (Trigger warning) Negative thoughts about loves ones dying or what is the point of life etc
7. Worst of all, the panic attack just makes me feel I'm gonna die and it's the worst feeling eve

I'm not on any medication and wanna go through this with some routine changes. I've managed to handle some of it by some positive approach but it pops up once in a while, usually during an exam or a day before that, or just randomly. So:

1. Any home remedies or protips that don't involve medication?, as I don't want to go into antidepressants or addictive drugs as I've heard alot of horror stories.

2. Also, has anyone else discovered that they had anxiety only during the start of covid?
I wanna know if I'm the only one that had this triggering event in my life and whether this is a life-long mental illness or will it go away once life goes back to normal in a few years?

I was informed that they change my approval date from May to July so anything after July will be denied and it up to my job attendance policy which at this point I will be fired for the mount of days missed. I went to my doctor to talk to her and she told me she can’t do nothing. But even worse my dad got the same notice we work together so there a chance he may also be let go. I really wanted have everything thing just end I’m tired trying to prove that there something I going to therapy and still that not enough. I am afraid to close my eyes because I’m at the point I just don’t want to wake up.,2021-09-24 11:52:14
pudvp3,I’m afraid that no one will like me because of the way I treat them,I feel like I’m the most rude and crass person ever. I hate who I am and the way that I interact with the world. I have no idea how other people perceive me and I’m afraid is just an ever-quickening process of them realizing how horrible I am.,2021-09-24 11:47:22
pudqe8,I maybe had Social anxiety 3 years ago. But i felt fine after going through it for a year and a half.

pud94u,"I embarrassed myself during a debate because my anxiety kicked in, I don’t usually cry but man that was so embarrassing and they kept on laughing at me","There was a debate earlier in class that I have prepared for but then it was my turn to answer the opposing team’s question. My mind then went blank and I kept on slurring and stuttering my words. I can see how the opposing team was laughing and my team was clearly disappointed in me. I don’t cry in most situations that I embarrassed myself, but this is the first time that I cried after the debate and I want to physically harm myself due to humiliation. Idk what I should do to stop crying and wanting to hurt myself due to embarrassment",2021-09-24 11:01:03
pud8n1,Hand numbness after panic attack,"Hi, f (20), around 2 hours ago I had a panic attack. In the middle of it, my palms and fingers started feeling numb and tingly.

pud7rc,I’m paralysed by indecisiveness about moving uni accommodation,"On Sunday I moved into university. I moved into catered accommodation and immediately hated it. I wanted self catered originally when I booked but the only thing they could offer me was catered. I hated it immediately and was desperate to move. The reasons for this are that I find cooking very enjoyable and want to improve at it and I don’t enjoy the times we have to eat amongst other things. I emailed accommodation services asking if I could move and they said yes and I viewed a place. 

However once I realised I could move, I immediately started to see all the things that weren’t so bad about being in catered accommodation, for example, I met more people and I have already made a couple of friends. Now I have to make a decision and I’m paralysed by indecisiveness. Whatever I decide, I change my mind in half an hour. I can see some positives in both and some negatives. I cannot really see myself staying in this accommodation - it doesn’t really feel like me and the one I viewed was much nicer, however I have already met a couple of good people here and worry I might miss out on meeting more. I could really hate my flatmates. I’m sure whatever decision I make I will have times where I regret it. I was also worried about moving to a new place because once I decided to move it could take a while to get everything sorted with leaves me with more time to overthink and change my mind again. I’ve called multiple family members and friends but I am no closer to coming to a conclusion confidently. 

I hate how indecisive I am. I wish I was more confident and all I do is overthink this. I haven’t been sleeping and I’ve changed my mind three times in the past hour. I hate my brain so much. This is mental torture. Maybe nothing will help and I’m just venting but I’m at the point of having suicidal thoughts because this is killing me so much.  I just wish I was capable of making a decision and sticking to it.",2021-09-24 10:58:32

pucsn2,Lazy or do I not need to work?,"I work full time as a carer every evening and once every other day from daytime. I like the day inbetween where I have the day to myself to possibly be able to get the little meagre things done on my list. I still find this a struggle and don’t think there’s enough time in the day. I wanted to get a 2 day a week job for 8 hours to make the most but this job I’m having a trial at today starts at 7. I never actually calculated how long 8 hours would be, like I said not enough hours in the day. Which means getting up at 5/5:30 minimum so I’m not late coz I always am til half 4. Plus waking up in the dark makes me feel shitty and being tired generally makes me fragile. I like waking up by the sun or naturally not by alarm and although the work of this job is something I’d enjoy they said ideally they would want me to work 3/4 days and the time I have to be up by now is killing me the thought of it. It feels unnatural. I think they should hire someone more able to work their hours. 

I don’t need to work as I’m 19 live with my parents but it’s something I feel like I have to do, and I feel pathetic about the fact I can’t even muster up the courage to do so and guilty about letting them down before I’ve even started. I’m teary rn and I just want to go back to bed. Any advice? What shall I say to them?",2021-09-24 10:29:19
pucr2x,Just anxiety?,"Smoked a bit of weed and I’m usually good maybe I’m overthinking but I felt this weird like ‘muscle spasm’ on my head? Was my brain twitching? Also smoking a cig I know it’s not great? Maybe my brain is low on oxygen? Focus on breathing and drink water?

Just overthinking??

pucor9,Where do you look when the person next to you is talkin in a social setting?,"I'm afraid to ask anyone else in my life this question because it's probably socializing 101 for non-anxious folks. I'm seriously lost on this etiquette right now though.

So, I (30F) have a very talkative husband. I especially struggle in social settings when he's sitting next to me and there are others sitting in front of me (like in a booth at a restaurant where we're sitting across from our conversation partners). He tends to tell long stories and I feel like I'm stuck starting at him for minutes at a time without looking at the other people in the convo. I worry this is rude of me and that I should somehow be engaging with them while he's talking.

Should you try to keep your attention on the person next to you the whole time they're talking? I typically only look at people when they're talking, or maybe when they laugh or make another noise contributing to the discussion. I feel awkward when I make eye contact with someone when they're not the one talking. Am I supposed to be looking around at everyone in the group the whole time?",2021-09-24 10:21:59
puckt9,I wrote a poem about my anxiety,"It’s not much, but writing has always been my outlet and I’m proud because it’s been awhile since I wrote anything. I been going through a really rough time lately, I attempted suicide about two weeks ago, I been feeling really alone, tomorrow is my birthday which I hate, and I just been having negative thoughts. I hate “it” whatever it is in my brain that makes me sick. But I also know things will eventually look up. I just wanted to post my poem somewhere, share it with people who understand. 

“It”

Where does it come from?

I let it wreck my day, ruining it instantly 

I try my best to not let it overpower me 

It’s always easier said then done

It’s the best at getting the worst out of me 

In truth it’s the best at practically everything 

Its the best at making my head pound like a hammer getting bashed repeatedly into a brick wall 

Its the best at making my heart beat faster then a baby bird’s wings at first flight 

Its the best at making my stomach repel anything it’s given spewing bile like a broken faucet 

Its the best at making me want to sleep my days away 

But still is somehow the best at not letting me fall into that comfort of sweet slumber when I need it most 

It is the best at making me want to cry a pool bigger then all the oceans 

It is the best at making me believe the knot in my stomach is something I will forever live with 

It is the best at making me believe the overwhelming thoughts in my head are actually true 

It is the best at letting the darkest of thoughts take rest inside my mind

It is the best at using its tiny little demented claws dig its way into the deepest part of me 

I hold on to hope that I am better 

At least better then whatever this monster in my head is

Whatever this disturbed creature is, I know I am stronger 

And with that knowledge,  I tell myself…

As tremendous as it is at all of these things, the underlying truth will always stand that nothing is perfect 

It too will lose its strength and with that, 

The hammer will stop pounding 

The baby bird will learn how to command a calm, smooth stride 

The faucet will finally get repaired, letting the spew subside

I will get my sleep when the time is right

No sooner 

No later 

The tears will continue to stream but that is more then acceptable 

No matter what it tells me, crying does not make me weak 

It may not make me stronger either 

But it releases me of some of the pain and I’ll take that for now so let them fall as they will

The knot in my stomach will unravel and be tied into a beautiful bow 

The non stop thoughts in my head will fade 

The even darker thoughts will be shooed away, no longer welcome to rest  

This may not be as rapidly as I would like but they will be gone non the less 

It’s claws will lose its grip on me and it will slowly clear out of me altogether, even from the most shallow depths 

Nothing has ever hurt me as much as it has 

But as good as it is at the worst

It will never vanquish me 

It may humble me, but there is nothing wrong with that 

As painful as it is to fight 

Nothing will ever be more worth a fight then defeating it 

Because nothing would ever hurt as much as letting it take the best from me 

Although it’s tried many times before, it has never won

It’s come close 

But that’s no victory",2021-09-24 10:14:24
pucchl,Looking for help with blood donation anxiety,"I was really excited to donate blood for the first time, as I haven't been able to my entire life. That is, until my roommate mentioned how when he got his blood taken he felt extremely nauseous like he was going to get sick in the middle of the process. I'm extremely emetophobic and now I'm terrified this is going to happen to me during the donation process. I've never heard of something like that happening before, and it's all I can think about now which is triggering anxiety. I'm not even sure if I'm at the minimum weight requirement. Along with that I'm on my period which isn't helping. I'm just not sure what to do now, and I'm getting really scared.",2021-09-24 09:58:36

puc42i,I want to be normal again,"I just turned 18 today, and I have life plans that I love working towards. It's just too hard to achieve them currently. So I gave myself anxiety when I was going into 9th grade, (5 years ago) just believed i had it so much that I developed a problem, and I've been fucked ever since. Except for about a 3 month streak where my parents made me fight through the anxiety, put me on a plane to England, (with my dad) and my anxiety just vanished once I was there. We got back a few days later and I felt great still, I even got a job for a couple months. Then covid started so I left the job, stayed at home, and now I'm useless again. It's a different type of anxiety from before my trip though. This anxiety stems almost entirely of a fear of throwing up in public. Before my trip, if I were to throw up in public, I would have been horrified, but that wasnt really a concern I had so it never happened. Now though, I basically can't go anywhere unless I've been there before, and I know where the bathrooms are. I took another trip recently to Calgary (where I want to move to and start a life in) hoping it would just click my brain back to how it was after England. It kind of did, it made me very motivated and excited to get my act together and work towards moving out there. But it didn't completely kill my fear of throwing up. On that trip, I couldnt get on the train, I had a breakdown as it was coming in because there was no way I would be caught throwing up on a train and getting weird looks from everybody. That's when I realized I need to fix this. When I got back home I tried researching it, all I got was agoraphobia stuff. I do believe it's partially agoraphobia, but the results weren't really accurate. The cycle of events is, I feel fine, I think about how I'm feeling fine and start to panic, when I got anxious I feel like I'm going to throw up, when I feel like I'm gonna throw up I get anxious, and so on and so on. I don't thinks it's just agoraphobia because I don't have a fear of it really if I'm at home, like obviously I don't like throwing up, but I know that if I have to, I can. But in public places or transport etc, I know I can't throw up there, which makes me need to throw up. I remember an incident before my trip to England where I was in my friend's car, we'd just had a huge buffet meal, and I ate way too much. This was before I was scared of throwing up really, but I ended up just barely making it out of her car and throwing up in the parking lot. This didn't really affect me as I knew I just ate too much. Then probably like a year later with no problems, I have this fear. That's the only incident I can remember that could've brought this on, but since I didn't get affected by it until much later when I'd pretty much forgotten about it, I don't know it that's it.

Sorry I just kind of started rambling, I don't feel great right now and I just want to be like everyone else. 

Tldr: used to have anxiety, went on a trip, didn't have anxiety for 3 months at all, left my job and got a worse different kind of anxiety where I fall into a cycle of being anxious, making me feel like throwing up, which makes me very anxious that I'm going to throw up, etc. Don't think it's full blown agoraphobia since it's not the fear of throwing up as much as it is the fear of throwing up somewhere I'm not supposed to throw up.  (anywhere but a bathroom or my house basically) can't really go into public places unless I know where the bathrooms are, though I'm making some progress with short trips inside. What can I research to help myself with this/what can I do to help myself 

Thank you",2021-09-24 09:43:13
puc2hc,Does anyone else get numbness on their face and swallow all the time when they're anxious?,"I got my anxiety from a bad LSD trip where my nose started going numb and I spiraled from there which led me on a terrifying 4 hour trip which was all focused around my breathing, I never had anxiety before this experience but now the anxiety it has given me around my health and breathing is sometimes debilitating

When I get anxious I find that my face gets numb in the same spots that it did when I was on LSD, my nose (particularly my right nostril) get numb and I feel like when I breathe through my nose my nose isn't actually breathing which makes me panic more even though i know I'm actually fine but the feeling that comes over me is absolutely terrifying

I've also had an issue lately where I've become a lot more aware of my swallowing and feel the need to constantly swallow which leaves my throat dry and me unable to swallow, then when I try to swallow and can't I start to panic that my throat is closing and that makes it even harder to swallow which then makes me panic more

I've had a lot of health anxiety lately, started when I had some stomach issues that lasted 2 weeks and heart palpitations that I convinced myself I had heart disease and stomach cancer and from there everything I feel is just 'yep I can't breathe I'm dying'

Does anyone else have anything similar to this? Whether caused by LSD or not, because I just need to hear that these specific symptoms I'm feeling aren't exclusive to me so I feel like I'm not actually terminally ill",2021-09-24 09:40:18
puc0md,SSRIs saved my life,"My psychologist noticed my anxiety wasn’t getting any better after 2-3 years of sessions and she finally caved and told me to see a doctor about SSRIs. 

After a ridiculous process, I got them in March and started taking them. 

Fast forward to now, and I could honestly cry from relief. I feel like my anxiety has gone from 100 miles a minute to a decent 25. 

Is it gone? No. 

But holy fuck is there a massive difference. I didn’t notice it at first until I realized I wasn’t spending most of my day anxious and worried about every little thing. Wow. What a feeling to experience after 4 years of constant anxiety. I didn’t realize how bad it had gotten until now. I have lots to work on still but I’m in the best place I’ve been since probably 2015.

There is hope everyone. Keep going.",2021-09-24 09:36:51
pubzhe,Plane anxiety?,"My partner and I have been long distance for 2.5 years, and haven’t seen each other since December 2019 thanks to the worldwide panorama. Things are starting to open back up and I want to go visit him in Norway this Christmas (I applied to travel there and was approved). I had my first big panic attack this April and have been dealing with anxiety and panic attacks ever since. It was really rough for a while. I’ve since learned how to cope with the panic a little better, but the thing that still really freaks me out is the thought of traveling. From being at the airport, to being stuck in a small place (the plane) for 14+ hours where I could potentially be exposed to COVID (I am vaccinated but have health anxiety), to being in an unfamiliar place for an extended period of time, to seeing my partner who I haven’t seen in TWO YEARS… just the idea of it can trigger a panic attack. I miss my partner so much and I want to be brave and go see him. I don’t want my anxiety to keep me from living a full life.

Whenever I start to feel an anxiety attack coming I start counting and saying the alphabet at the same time

(For example 1 A 2 B 3 C ect.) It’s meant to get your brain concentrating on on what the next letter is and the number following and takes your mind off the cause of anxiety 

It doesn’t help 100% of the time but for those minor issues that you just need a distraction from it has been a good distraction method for me",2021-09-24 09:21:42

So the thing that causes it mostly is intrusive thoughts. Man they’re like the worst thing ever. Like having a horror movie specifically catered to you that plays on loop. 

I’m trying to get better at letting them go, but tonight is just kind of hard. I missed up my medication schedule and also thought downing sugar (particularly chocolate) was a good idea. 

I know they’re not real, but dammit they just feel so real in the moment. And yknow what? I don’t get people who say being scared is fun. Like I kinda get it, but when your brain overthinks to the point where sewing machines can make you panic you kinda start to wonder how anyone can think scary is fun.

puayfh,Irrational fear of going to jail even though I did nothing illegal,"I feel like I am going crazy. The past year has been very difficult for me. I have always had intrusive thoughts but I was never diagnosed. Now I think it is OCD/anxiety. I keep imagining scenarios in my head. Of things that could happen. It started with little things but now I can barely focus on anything else. It is like my whole life revolves around my intrusive thoughts. Even people around me have started commenting that I look sad all the time. I used to be so cheerful. It started out of nowhere. I was watching this movie about a man being sentenced to a long time in prison though he was innocent. And I started thinking about everything I ever did in my life. Even thought I have never done anything wrong, what if I get falsely accused or someone tries to frame me for something I did not do. I started researching different cases online. Read about laws which might be used against me...case histories.. .potential lawyers..etc etc.  I imagine situations where past/future boyfriends will resent me for breaking up and do something bad to me..it is gotten so bad that there barely goes a minute where I don't think about it.. I think about the shame this will bring to my parents. .I think I need help. I want to start enjoying life again. I want to wake up happy. I saw a post while I was scrolling through reddit which reminded me of my situation and I thought it will help me put things in perspective if I put it down in words.

puaoke,"I'm only two weeks into a new job and I feel stupid, overwhelmed, and miserable","I took a job with a small company but it turned out to be way smaller than I had anticipated. On their website they had about 13 employees listed so I never thought to ask about it during the interview process but it turns out the whole business model is that the owner just uses contractors and part time employees and even other super small businesses of like 2-4 people that come and go and I'll be the only full time employee.

Which means I have to learn so much and basically be the second-hand person for my boss and I feel like I'll literally never be able to get to that point because there's just so much and I'm falling behind. I keep getting asked to do more and more tasks and it feels like it is piling up so quickly and the people who are training me will likely be gone at the end of the month and then I'll be completely on my own. But the worst part is there literally isn't anyone who could feasibly help me because again...I'm on my own. If it would have truly been the size it was listed as on the website I would have felt much more comfortable.

My boss seemed to really like me when she wanted to hire me and thought I'd be such a great employee but I feel like an idiot fraud who is going to end up bombing really hard at this job and ruining the whole business because I won't be able to do all the work satisfactorily and it takes me so long to do many tasks on top of that I end up working later at night.

I keep trying to be positive about it and just a few weeks ago I was so happy to finally have a job after a year of nothing and now I feel consumed and like a failure because I fear having to quit or be fired from my first real job out of college. I just feel like such a loser already and I don't know what to do with myself.

I haven't been to the dentist for 3 years and it's been harder to go since covid. I'm currently stationed in Germany, and my options are limited.
I'm sure I have a few cavities and gingivitis.
I just want to be able to smile and not worry. I don't want to worry about bad breath (although at this point I can't tell if I even have it or not. Let alone, if brushing will be enough to fix it if I do)

I guess I'm just looking for advice and how to go about taking care of my teeth if I'm worried about brushing chipping them.",2021-09-24 08:04:54

pua4ma,Vistaril or any medication for basketball performance,"Vistaril (hydroxyzine) while basketball

I like playing basketball with friends and for the most part, I’m relaxed. However, we’re entering a tournament and those types of situation usually gives me major anxiety so I tend to tense up and overthink. 

I also noticed that there’s times when I’d hit my weed pen like an hr before games or would smoke Delta 8 CBD, I feel a lot better and perform better. 

I was prescribed by my doctor some Hydroxyzine (Vistaril) 2 months ago but I never took it. My question is that, will taking Vistaril while playing basketball cause performance issues? I’ve read some side effects on drowsiness and possibly brain fog. 

If vistaril is not a good idea, any recommendations to relax while playing Bball to calm the nerves?",2021-09-24 07:41:15

pu8z2j,Physics class gave me panic attacks until I met my classmate,"I'm a university student, and I've always hated math. I failed physics my first year, and put it off until my third, which is why I'm taking it now. I feel very insecure about my abilities, and I've been especially anxious about the physics tutorial where we have to 'work together' with our classmates. I've been there, in elementary through to university, when the teacher would call on me and I would have no idea what the answer was, until the anxiety made me just shut down. I always felt like the dumbest kid there. To avoid situations like that, I over-prepare and do the assignment before the class. Except last week, I had a panic attack when I wasn't able to solve the assignment beforehand, and ended up not going to my tutorial because I was so anxious.

Not an excuse I know, and I'm getting a tutor, but that's not the point of this story.

I told myself last week that I had to go to the second tutorial no matter what. So, today was the day. I went to the class with my completed assignment, and felt reasonably good about my answers. Until the teacher said, ""Get into your groups from last week!""

Well I didn't attend last week, and I was really regretting it because now I was going to have to ask random people to take pity on me and let me into their group. A nightmare, basically.

Until he showed up. He was sitting by himself, not interacting with anyone, until he went up to the front of the class and said he didn't have a group, so who could he join?

To sum things up, we became a group of 2.

Now, I may have had the correct answers to this stuff, but this guy just understood each question at first glance. Working with him was like having my own personal physics tutor. If I didn't know he was a first year I would've thought he was the TA. But this is where things got interesting.

As we went through each question, he would be like, ""Good, that's right,"" ""You're doing really well,"" ""Great job!"" and this tutorial class turned into like an hour of constant praise from him (words of affirmation is my top love language, so this was really appreciated). Sometimes he would make a correction, and just ask for my pencil and re-draw whatever I'd missed, or check in when I seemed confused and make sure I understood the concept. I've honestly never had such a positive interaction in a learning environment. This guy was something else.

Interesting event #2: I have a lot of wavy/curly hair, and I tend to play with it when I'm nervous, which I was because *physics*. A strand of hair got stuck to my pencil, and when he asked me to pass it so he could write something, the hair fell on the page. And this kid, who I'd met literally 1 hour before, *picked up the hair and tossed it off the desk.* He didn't comment, just kept talking like nothing had happened. Maybe I'm just a germaphobe - but touching things that are/were attached to humans is like a level up for me, and I would not have picked up an almost-stranger's hair (let me know if I'm alone in this lol). I'm probably overreacting, but I was kind of ... impressed. And weirdly in awe of this dude who is a master at physics and doesn't care about germs.

Anyway, class ended, he DM'd me photos of our assignment, and that was that! All in all, a good day.

If you've made it here, thank you for reading my wholesome tale! This was way too long, sorry :( I wanted to get it off my chest but didn't know who to tell.

TLDR; Hated physics until I met a classmate who taught me that learning doesn't have to be anxiety-inducing.",2021-09-24 06:30:36
pu8xyd,Anxiety about starting to take SSRI again. Please Help!!!,"Hey guys it’s been a while since I posted. I have had anxiety for a few years and put on 50mg of Zoloft and it helped a lot. About a year ago I got off because I was doing so good. Fast forward to today I lost my pops who I was extremely close to and a close friend of mine in the span of 3 weeks. I’ve relapsed so bad! My doc wants me to start Zoloft again. I’m just barely able to function as is but I am terrified to start meds because I had horrible side effects going on and getting off. I’m worried what if Zoloft won’t work again. What if I react bad this time and have serious side effects. What if my anxiety gets worse. I’m so scared about everything right now. I don’t want the side effects of the meds to be so bad I can’t work because I’ve already took a week off 2 weeks ago.

pu8408,I spent 10 days in an Inpatient Psych Ward.,"I haven't seen many posts on the sub regarding inpatient treatment and I figured I would share my experience with it. 

On September 11th my wife and my dad sat me down and told me I needed more help. I was about 7 months into medication and outpatient therapy, and on three meds. For about a month previously I had been in a dark and darkening place. I had lost my job due to my worsening anxiety and depression, something I was happy about actually. That job was nothing but trouble for me. However, during that month I was not improving with my daily depression and anxiety. I was spending all night and day by myself. Disassociating too. I was alot worse than I that I was too. I'm thankful for my support system being honest with me.

Anyway, that night I went to the local ER to get admitted. It took about two hours to get moved up to the psych floor. They didn't allow any type of string on shoes, hoodies, pants, shorts, or your phone, ipod ect. When they got me situated in my room they also did an intake with me, I had to sign a bunch of stuff and consent to treatment. The people were wonderful and tried to get stuff done fast cause I was on the verge of having a panic attack. The next day I spent eating meals in our lunchroom and sleeping, even though I was sleeping almost 10 hours a day I was still exhausted. But once the week started we had groups where we all (all the other patients, nursing students and counselors) talked about our problems. That was incredibly helpful to me. People who had it worse or had different problems than me. It helped me feel not so alone in the hospital. 

It turned out that my issue was mainly a medication problem. One of my meds sent me into a downward spiral. Changing meds was scary but the hospital was honestly the best place to do it. Meds are tricky and getting the wrong one isn't always so obvious. The psychiatrist in the hospital developed a plan for me that includes learning more coping techniques, changes meds, and sticking to a sleep schedule. There was essentially nothing to do besides shoot the shit with the other patients, draw with crayons or read I'd you had a softcover book so I was able to practice my coping techniques, and catch up on sleep. I know my experience isn't how everyone's is going to be but I just wanted to share it with the sub. Hopefully someone on the fence can make a better decision with this information if it was helpful. If you have any questions please don't hesitate to ask!",2021-09-24 05:38:23
pu80uf,I'm afraid I ruined one of my best friendships,"This may be a bit long so I apologize in advance. 

Me friend, we can call her Amanda, and I have known each other for about four years and we have been some of each other's best friends for much of this time. We tell each other almost everything about our lives, hang out quite often, and have never had a real bad fight before. An important point is that a big part of our friendship is poking fun at each other and making jokes at each other's expense, this has always been how our friendship goes (an example is that sometimes people will think that we are dating, to which Amanda will pretend to gag and talk about how disgusting that would be to her). 
About six days ago, while we were out with a group of new friends, I must have unknowingly gone a bit too far and some of these friends asked Amanda why I am so mean to her, which made her very uncomfortable to answer because she didn't know how to explain it. 

Later that night I also accidentally interrupted her as she made plans to go out to some bars with these friends which I hadn't planned to go on, and in talking to me she told them she'd wait for another Uber just to find out that there were no cars available and she couldn't go after all, which made me feel awful because I felt like I had ruined her night, even though she said it was fine and she would just go to bed and get more sleep than she would have otherwise. 

The next day I texted her again to apologize, when she sent paragraphs explaining how uncomfortable she had been the day before and how she felt that I had gone too far and me made her feel bad about herself with my teasing. I felt terrible and tried again to apologize to which she added that I have made her feel bad when she tells me about guys that she talks to and that she no longer feels comfortable telling me these things because she thinks I am too judgmental and only make her feel bad about it. I admit that I have been very upfront about how I feel about guys she talks to, and I know looking back that I should have been more tactful about it. The reason I am very forward about it is because recently she had been talking to an ex of hers who was awful and verbally abusive to her, which I told her right away I thought was a stupid idea and she should think about getting involved with him again and that I could not bring myself to support her in that. 

I can see that I made her feel as though I was calling her stupid for what she had done, although in my mind I believed that was the only way to get my point across about how I thought it would end badly and end with her hurt, because we have never been the kind to have a heart to heart with each other and I don't feel like she would take me seriously if I tried to have a serious talk with her about it because that has never been how we talk to each other. I am not trying to be very protective of her because we are not dating, neither of us wants to date the other, and I know she is an adult who can take care of herself. But I do care about her getting hurt and I don't want her to get hurt again, especially by the same person who has done it before. 

I spent several days trying to text her to talk with her about these issues and she would always tell me that ""we can talk in a little bit I have to do X right now"" followed by silence until around 9 or 10pm when she would ask if we could do it the next day because it was getting late, which I would agree to because I don't want to push her and give her space if she needs it. 

We finally talked last night and she said that she is not angry at me and just needed to get some things off her chest, and I explained that I had clearly gone too far without realizing it or realizing how I was making her feel.  She said it was ok and that she just needed to cool off a little, which made me feel better. But then today she would still hardly talk to me in class and when I asked her what she was doing this afternoon she said she was tired and wanted to nap, but then immediately agreed to go shopping with another new friend and they ran off together immediately when class ended. 

This new friend is also a woman and I know Amanda had said that she was excited to have some girl friends because she has usually been friends mostly with guys and I understand that and I'm not trying to stop her from making friends and hanging out with them. But to me it feels as though she's just decided to shut me out and essentially replace me with these new friends. She'll hardly talk to me in person, and when I text her she will never respond with more than a sentence and it's always something about how she's doing something with these other friends. 

I have asked if she needs space and I try not to bother her too much about anything because I still feel like she does not want to talk to me, but she told me that it's all fine and I don't need to leave her alone or anything like that. 

I am afraid that I ruined my relationship with one of my best friends and even though I try to tell myself that she may just need some space, I am terrified that when I crossed that line, I crossed some point of no return and we may never have the same relationship again.",2021-09-24 05:33:22
pu7yqt,Finally making progress,"For me (17M), ever since grade 8 when I was 13 I honestly believe I had depression and anxiety. I was always so worried about what everyone thought of me, I always felt awkward and “not normal”, and I was never happy. I just thought that’s what happened when you hit puberty and started growing up, that all adults felt like that

My anxiety has always been very closely related to the way I look, I have noticed that throughout the years. I always thought that I looked different from everyone else for some reason, and I grew up always being the small and weak kid. Even now when I’m much bigger I forget that everyone doesn’t look at me like a kid sometimes. On bad days whenever I’m feeling anxious, I always think that my face looks weird and my hair looks bad, even though obviously is doesn’t look much different than on good days. Whenever I am feeling anxious I lose all my self confidence and self esteem. I start to think my outfits looks bad. On good days however, I think I look good and handsome, and I can tell myself that nobody pays that close attention to how I look other than me, and I’m only able to truely believ that when I have my good days. 

Finally, this summer my entire life changed. I went to the doctor for something I thought was unrelated, and he told me it was a symptom of anxiety (the symptom was super weak and shaky legs). He recommended me to a councillor, and ever since I finally talked to someone about it and acknowledged it, my anxiety has gotten so much better. This whole thing happening in the summer helped a lot because I’m always way happier in the summer. Those 2 months this year were the happiest I had ever been in my life

Then, the first 2 weeks of college hit. My anxiety started coming back, but in a different shape than before. Now I was just always worried about things, and always felt on edge and shaky. Over the past 2 weeks now I have kind of worked through it. My anxiety is getting so much better and I’m making progress 

Obviously I still have bad days, and it can be hard to keep myself positive. For example, today I had no classes at all and I told myself I would sleep in then get homework done and have a productive day. I did sleep in, but I did almost no homework at all. I just felt so on edge all day, and couldn’t stop worrying about how I look even though i knew it didn’t matter because I would be in my room all day. Still, I find that dresses nicely helps my anxiety so I tried to wear clothes I thought looked good but for some reason with my anxiety I keep overhung it and thinking they look bad when I know they don’t 

Even though this seems like a post complaining about how bad my anxiety is, it’s really meant to be a progress and celebration post because over the past 4 months I have done so much work to make myself happier and better my anxiety. It just seems negative because today wasn’t the best day, but I thought writing about my progress might help

Hopefully this story helps other people too! And if anyone has tips on how to work on my self confidence and stop questioning my looks while anxious please let me know! Thanks",2021-09-24 05:30:14

I am currently trying to run to help with the treatment with my GAD / Depression, I was wondering what would be a safe heart rate for me?",2021-09-24 05:02:25
pu7f6o,THOUGHTS...,"I was bullied a lot when I was a kid. I mean from like age 7 to 20. I realized it had an effect on my feelings as an adult(I am 44), but now I am realizing it really screwed up how I see the world. Like I always realized I have depression, anxiety, etc. but now I am realizing those are my baseline. On top of that a lot self-hatred.

But now I am just frustrated because I wasn't like physically or sexually abused or anything so are my problems ""that big""? And I have had plenty of times to ""fix/work"" on myself...and somehow I keep regressing. I mean I have done years of therapy, medications, tms, ketamine, recently ect. But somehow all I have ended up with is a lot of unsafe thoughts.

Just curious what people's thoughts are...and if there was something specific people might have done for past trauma that helped.

Thanks,

pu778u,Horrible day,Today I had the opportunity to take a retest after school. So I showed up to the class and started the test. Right away I started to depersonalize and get a little anxious. But as I got to the middle of the test I couldn't understand anything and I was holding back sobbing from the anxiety and depersonalization. As I walked home I couldn't tell what was real and couldn't breath while I was crying all th way home. Idk if I'm fully back yet even 5 hours after rh fact.,2021-09-24 04:46:22
pu76ly,I feel like a failure because I had to leave school,"TLDR: Is it possible to overcome feelings of deep regret over something, even if it was out of my own control?

I had to leave school because of a few different mental health issues that I was facing, anxiety and depression being at the forefront of it.

Ever since I left, I haven’t been able to leave my house or see my friends. This has all happened during the majority of my teenage years, and I’m so scared that I’ll never be able to catch up developmentally.

All the memories I’ve missed out on, all the growing. I feel like a failure and am filled with regret, even though if I didn’t leave school I probably would have taken my own life.

I know mental illness is a very real and valid reason for this happening, but I struggle with self-compassion since I can’t actually see mental illness. I’m not physically chained to my house, yet I can’t bring myself to leave. I keep asking myself what if I tried harder? Maybe did something differently?

Does anyone know if it’s possible to overcome these feelings of regret and possible self-hatred?",2021-09-24 04:45:27
pu7469,Daily vomiting every morning for a month (Please help me),"Wondering if anyone else has experienced this or has any insight that might help me.

I (25F) have generalized anxiety disorder (and have had it since I was a kid). In the past, I have experienced feeling sick to my stomach and vomiting when I was very anxious, but it was always one day and then it would go away for a period of time. It would happen on the day of big events usually.

About a month ago, after a very stressful period, I started waking up feeling sick to my stomach and I would vomit within about 5 minutes of waking up. I have thrown up almost every day in the last month. After I throw up, I feel much better and don't feel sick for the rest of the day.

The only thing that has brought me any relief is going for a walk immediately after waking up, but sometimes the feeling is too strong and I throw up before I can go on my walk.

This is affecting my sleep and my ability to work in the mornings. And obviously, no one wants to be sick every single day.

So... what is this? I am particularly perplexed by the fact that I feel better/a sense of relief after throwing up. How do I intervene? What kind of professional can help me? I have discussed with my doctor and psychologist and they are both at a loss. Has anyone else experienced this?

Edit: I have seen a psychiatrist and have been on many different anxiety meds (currently on Zoloft) and have seen a CBT psychologist for the last 2 years.",2021-09-24 04:41:48
pu6y5t,Things to help reduce palpitations,My daughter has been having palpitations since she got the depo shot a little over a week ago. They happen randomly. Yesterday they happened at school but today they didn’t. They mainly happen at home when she is in bed and I can tell it’s worrying her. I took her to the ER a few days ago and they found nothing wrong. It’s really causing my anxiety to peak. I was wondering if there are any teens on here that deal with it and what do you guys do to reduce it? I hate that I’ve given a lot of my anxiety to her probably at birth.

pu5r4n,This feels like deja vu and it makes me feel crazy,"I’ve had heart palpitations since I was a teen, but originally I didn’t even notice or worry about them. They did a holter monitor when I was in high school and everything came back fine from what I remember. 

Then, a few years ago, after my health anxiety first began, I started noticing heart palpitations, a fast heart rate and some mild light headedness when I stood up. I made an appointment with a cardiologist myself, and had all the tests done — an EKG, an ultrasound of my heart and I wore a another holter monitor. At the end they said I had a slightly fast heart rate, but it was nothing to worry about, maybe it was due to my excess weight and I felt relieved there was nothing wrong.

At the start of the pandemic I was experiencing some palpitations again, this time at night, but after about a month or so they went away on their own and I chalked it up to stress. I got a new doctor and he performs EKGs as part of routine care, I had one a month ago and again, same slightly fast heart rate as always but nothing to worry about. 

This past week I’ve twice almost convinced myself I’m having a heart attack for various reasons—pain in my arm or my jaw, or palpitations. I just had my first appointment with a new therapist yesterday and I was excited to start working on my anxiety. 

Then, this morning, after I ate breakfast I had a fast heart rate, palpitations, and a little dizziness when standing. It’s lasted all day and I’ve tried and failed to not let it freak me out. I talked to my Mom and she said if it makes me feel better I should just go see a cardiologist again, and initially I agreed but now I’m thinking what would be the point? 

I have a sinking feeling that I’m going to go through all of the tests, wear the monitor, and they’re just going to tell me it’s nothing to worry about, it’s my anxiety and/or my weight and send me on my way. 

I don’t want there to be anything wrong, I don’t want to be sick, but things as they are now make me feel totally crazy. I just feel so stuck and I don’t know what to do.",2021-09-24 03:29:02
pu5r3w,Thoughts about CBD?,"I've been struggling with anxiety since I can remember without knowing I have anxiety and it keeps getting worse. every time I thought I beat it it comes back stronger. I never took medication to treat it but I smoked weed for 15 years, and I am 7 years sober now.   
when I realised I have anxiety a few years ago, I read books, practiced sport, meditation, change entire life style and diet, even had therapy last year but never wanted to be on any medications, because I believed I can beat it if I can change the way I think and be more aware of my thought... to this day, I still don't know what triggers it, sometimes it seems that it 's coming out of nowhere. the problem is every time my anxiety level is high I become highly dysfunctional as I get physical symptoms. I've been thinking about CBD for years now as I am becoming more disparate that I can fix.   
please let me know your thoughts or experience with CBD.  
thank you all! wish you all the best!",2021-09-24 03:29:01
pu5p38,Venting about living in a favility that also treats anxiety.,"Trigger Warning: Criticism

I've just got to vent. I live in a place for almost two years now that treats people with various diorders, but I came to there because of anxiety.  I need support because I feel miserable there and I could leave , but they dont allow me and now would not be good time because of college stress they say. It would be rational to stay, but emotionally I want to leave. I have my own room and stuff , but like the caretakers are making me question my sanity. They will analyze every word I say for discrepancies and accuse me of lying. Once they went so far as to call my school and found out that I did not leave at 8 but at 8:30. It makes me anxiuos now to tell them anything because they will say I always say something different. The thing i can't remember everything of days ago.  Tody they shouted at me for not telling them when I would arrive home. I did not because they personally insult me whenever I say I will be late. They say I am shit and every little mistake I may do is immediately a sign that I am not to be trusted or independent enough.
And because I cannot be trusted apparently I am not ready to go.
I feel so uncomfortable and I want to defend myself, but I cannot stay rational and stand up for myself when I am belittled and treated as I child. I tried many times but it is futile to discuss when they wont listen to the big picture. 
So I just walk away, because that helps me to calm down a bit.
I went there because of my parents, I thought  it would help, but I don't need them, I have a therapist that helps me somewhere else, however the change comes from myself . And I sldo find that I can manage living alone. I just want my own life, a life that is not restricted, but I cant find the strength to say these words.

pu2a5u,Behind most high level Anxiety and most Panic Attacks lies unresolved past trauma,"Anxiety and Panic Attacks are a product of the body. Our bodies are memory organs just like our brains in which past experiences are stored. The body works differently than our brain in terms of storing memories. The brain communicates in terms of thoughts, the body in terms of feelings and emotions. As Anxiety and Panic Attacks belong in the realm of feelings, it is a product of our body, not our brain.

When we experience high levels of anxiety or a panic attack, our body is reminded of an experience in the past that was a threat. It is trying to prevent the outcome of that threat.

Our brains are ready to move forward, however, our body is not assured this will turn out well and therefor stops us from allowing to take that action. It does so with every means possible and the experience can be scary: dizziness, heart palpitations, fainting or experiences you will faint, etc. Often our fear of Panic Attacks makes the problem worse and becomes a main contributor.

My experience is that the only way to move beyond this is to unpack that traumatic or potentially traumatic experience from the past. It is important to see to what extent the conclusion of it is real and whether it does resemble the current situation. Then we can slowly retrain our bodies. We can do so by pushing our body gently, one moment at the time through some discomfort to let it discover the threat is not there or not as scary as it assumed. Back off when it becomes too much and gently resume.

I have been dealing with this for 30 years and only in the last 5 have I been able to go beyond what my body allowed for. It has been a complicated thing to tackle.

I have seen my primary care several times about and she has run a ton of blood tests, everything came back normal. I've seen a few specialists, including a sleep lab, and everything looks normal. I get 7-8 hours of sleep per night. Who knows if it is quality sleep but I don't wake up for long periods of time during the night.

I do have a history of generalized anxiety (about nothing in particular) and this past year has been particularly rough. I've felt disconnected and depersonalized a lot and had some panic attacks here and there. But I've never felt this tired/lethargic before.

Which brings me here. Am I depressed? I don't feel sad, persay, but I am also not someone who is very in touch with my emotional state.

I do what I can, and now I'm getting better at responding. But if I don't meet your expectations, it's not because of laziness. I got demons on my shoulders and I'm doing what I can to shut them up.",2021-09-24 00:08:47

pu1hbd,First time seeking help - I will be grateful to hear about your personal experience :D,"Hello! I'm new to both Reddit and this sub.I have heard from people over the years that Reddit is great for information/communities of similar interests to get together in general, so here I am.

Not only am I new to Reddit, but I am also new in trying to help myself with my anxiety.

I have anxiety and depression, undiagnosed and untreated as I have never sought help before.I am planning to have an appointment with a doctor, and I am looking at self-help resources from my government website and feeling hopeful that I will be going on a journey towards recovery.

&#x200B;

If you could share any personal tips you have from when you first tried to seek professional and unprofessional help, I would greatly appreciate it 🥰 Something like what to expect and what helped you most throughout recovering!

&#x200B;

Thank you\~\~

&#x200B;

\---- Extra details/questions you can scroll over/read through and answer if you want!I'm happy hearing advice with the focus only on the top part :D ----

&#x200B;

Did talking to people close to you help you? Has it ever somehow gone bad?

I'm scared to talk to any family members and friends about it yet - they might be dealing with a lot themselves and not have the space in their mind for it/scared friends might walk on eggshells around me.  
I'm currently flatting & not living with my family + have an ongoing fear of something bad about me influencing my family members' mental health/peace of mind, so it's a bit harder to bring myself to bring it up :(

&#x200B;

Although I'm trying to take a step into seeking help now, it is still hard to face all the neglect I've done socially and academically, even up to recent days. I am afraid I will feel defeated again and fall into limbo as I try to undo the damage. I am actually in between trying to finish a late assignment this very moment lul😭Do you have any tips in powering through this and staying hopeful and motivated- if you have a similar experience?",2021-09-23 23:57:35
pu1c4h,Unknown Form of Anxiety,"Ok so long story short I've never had anxiety before in my life until recently (sort of) I've had panic attacks before while on acid at school and one other huge time when I did 3.5g of mushrooms..(honestly feel like I've gotten PTSD from it.
Well after those experiences I've never had anxiety until the start of covid here in the US. It hit me hard everyday for like 3+ weeks I would wake up and be anxious all day till it got night. Not even about anything in particular just knew I felt off and on edge. Eventually it went away through prayer (whole other topic). Well now that covids (slowed down) I've been fine once more until recently again every couple days I start feeling uneasy and cold or just anxious but I can't pin point a reason why I'm not shy I'm not a quiet person. I wonder to this day I'd it's the drugs or just something I need to get over with a new train of thought or something.... Has anyone felt the same or done the same things I have?",2021-09-23 23:50:34
pu1a3e,Feel like I’m starting to develop agoraphobia,"Hi all,

A few months back I experienced a crazy panic attack that has had me spiralling ever since. 

Basically, I looked down at my hands and all of a sudden it felt like I had completely disconnected from them and so I freaked out. 

But that wasn’t even the worst one, I was OK after that - but then I went for just a couple of drinks at a housewarming, I felt dissociated again, looked down at my hands and same thing again. 

My brain is now crazy hyper aware of everything now, I got a new prescription for my glasses and even that has made my brain paranoid. 

I have been working at home and was asked to go into the office where I had ANOTHER panic attack. 

I feel like it’s becoming nearly everyday that I panic now. Not even at anything specific, just generally panicking about panicking. 

I’m sitting in my room in the darkness right now because I’ve had horrible nausea and anxiety all night. 

I’m on a waiting list for therapy but I just don’t know what to do. 

Struggling to get through the day because of chest pains, head tension and all that fun stuff. 

I keep being invited places but my brain always convinces me I’m going to dissociate… and sometimes I do.",2021-09-23 23:47:52
pu0z7q,Do you actually find online classes more anxiety inducing than real life classes?,"It seems to be the other way round for most people with anxiety disorders, so I’m wondering if there’s anyone else like me.

I just started college recently. Usually, I’m fine once I’m actually sitting in the class. But I am really struggling with the online classes.

I’ll try explain it best I can… like, I view home as my safe anxiety-free zone. I mentally separate it. It’s my space. When I’m physically in college, I can take my seat near the window, shrink back & quietly focus on my work, & if I feel anxiety coming on I can quietly excuse myself to the bathroom without anyone really noticing. In an online class, I’m VERY aware that people are looking at me and aware of my presence & that I have to talk. I feel exposed. My hands shake every time I try to click that “join call” button & it makes me want to cry.

Hope I’m not just being pathetic here lol.",2021-09-23 23:33:53
pu0v4s,I got better,"About 300 days ago I made a post on here about my anxiety being really bad and how I got fired after one day (27 minutes to be exact)due to my anxiety. I would throw up, poop a lot, get panic attacks, unable to leave my home, all that fun stuff. 
But now I have a job that I can actually do successfully, I can catch buses, I can talk to co-workers, I can ask for help, when I make mistakes I’m not embarrassed of them, I speak up, I am not worried about what people might think of me. 

I still get the anxiety poops and the dread of working but hey, who actually likes working in a supermarket. I can finally leave my home and feel nothing about it instead of crippling anxiety. 

Took a while but I found the right medication that worked for me but it was worth it. 


I am finally doing better.

I taught that it was anxiety induced but now after finding out that my issue should be checked with neurologist I got pretty anxious, didn't get full panic attack but my legs became cold and my brain went on 100% but I told doctor that I'm have every day anxiety and that I'm scared of having neurological disorder and he told me that that could be the way of may brain coping with anxiety so i shouldn't be worried because doctor will do everything necessarry to check me.

I get extremely anxious whenever she isn't having a good day (good day 1/7 days a week) and it gets hard for me to continue through the day because I'm so anxious I can barely function. I think I'm damaging our relationship with my anxiety because i start asking her to use words of affirmation more and more and that causes her to withdraw and back off even more.

I started therapy 6 months ago but I haven't made any progress, what would you you think?
Is medication a path that might help?

I used to have panic attacks in the past but haven’t had any for about 7-8 years - up until now. I guess it’s related to crazy Covid times (I had another vaccine last week) and stress, but I’m really having a hard time and wondering what should I do.

I’m on 75 mg of Zoloft, 15 mg of buspar and klonopin prn and I’m wondering if it’s time to bust out the klonopin until I’m better or until I can see my pdoc.

They’ll be sedating me with ketamine (so i won’t even need to go on oxygen or anything) and of course numbing my mouth, and then removing it. I’m terrified. I’ve never had surgery, I’ve never been sedated. The procedure should be less than an hour total. the dental surgeon has fantastic reviews. But everything that could potentially go wrong is running through my head. What if the IV for the sedation hurts so bad? what if i wake up during the procedure? what if i DONT wake up?! what if they take out one of my good teeth? any advice and reassurance is appreciated.",2021-09-23 22:54:52

Hypnosis

Meditation

Are these techniques real? I never meditated, I have never believed in hypnosis, I just don't know if this is real techniques, or is a scam?",2021-09-23 22:50:57
ptzx0a,Can anxiety cause these pains and cold night sweats?,"(24,F) I randomly started having deep lower right back pain in one spot that kept worsening while sitting in a car. Then a week later, my pain started to radiate to my bumcheeks and tailbone and started to waking up in the middle of the night with night sweats. A week again later, I now feel constant urge to pee(random sharp pains in vagina) and poop and pain in both lower sides of back and lower legs ache.

 I had a sports massage a couple days ago and the massage guy told me my pelvis was out of alignment and realigned me and gave me a remedial massage. Not sure if that’s helped because I’m still having pain in my lower back and buttocks.

I have been referred to see a general physician but the wait is long and can’t help but worry if it could be something worse. Could it be something as simple as torn muscle? Can torn muscles happen out of nowhere? Does it take this long to recover from them? Worried about every new symptom that comes..

I really dislike dressing up. I'm a big ugly troll, I look like shit whether I'm in a t-shirt and track pants or a suit. And the ambiguous dress code thing... ""business attire with jacket"". Look this up online and you'll get a bunch of advice for wearing scarves and cufflinks and weird suspenders and high-water pants that are so tight you can see your foreskin (or lack thereof). Yeah, that's not practical advice. 

I have so much trouble with these forced social things. I'm on friendly terms with everyone, but they're all business types and lawyers, and to them I'm just a computer janitor (I don't think of myself that way; I know I'm essential to the operation of the company).

Grounding exercises, helping her change habits, coming up with ways to comfortably alert me that she's having an attack, etc.

Last night, she had bad attack and I could think of what to do so I read Repunzel to her. It really helped. I've been able to calm her down by talking to her before. Apparently, according to her, my voice brings her back when the attacks happen.

Now, I have a plan. I want to find more stories to read for her. I want to record a few for when I'm not around too. Anyone know a website where I can find short, calming stories? Preferably not kids stories all the time. She's in her mid-20s

This happens especially in the mirror. If I look at myself for too long, I don’t recognize myself. I recognize the person that’s there but not as myself.

I don’t feel like Grace, I feel like I’m not real. Sometimes I do it when I’m talking to my friends and family. It’s like, this is a person that’s in my life and this is Grace’s life.

pty17h,Xanax prolonging mental health recovery?,"
TLDR-Anti Acids gave me intrusive anxiety. I was getting better after stopping, but then took my xanax, and adhd meds, and the anxiety returned a couple days later. Could it be one of the meds I took that caused me to go backwards?


So I'm not really active on this sub, but I thought people here would be of some help. 

To make a really long story short, early this summer I started having pain in my stomach that was diagnosed as gastritis. The anti acid I was prescribed caused really bad anxiety. Thankfully I had a xanax prescription as I have GAD. I didn't realize at the time the the anti acid was causing the anxiety, and thought it was just because of the stomach issues causing anxiety/depression. 

As time went on, the anxiety and depression continues to get more severe, to the point where I started having intrusive thoughts. 

During this time, because of my anxiety...I didnt want to even take my xanax(funny how that works)

I realized it was the anti acid, and stopped taking it. It took a few of weeks but I got to a point where I felt back to normal for about a week straight. For a couple of days I took my xanax at night to get a good night sleep, and I also took 1/4 of my adderall a couple days in a row(which I had also stopped for a while). 

Well a couple of days after that, out of NOWHERE, the anxiety and intrusive thoughts just hit me randomly, and its been about 8 days and it hasnt let up since. Because I was doing so well and thought I was just going back to my normal self, this was really unexpected...I was thinking that maybe the xanax or adderall threw me back out of balance or something. I havent taken either since, but have considered taking half a xanax(.5mg) to try and cope. I dont want to do this if this is just going to prolong the healing process. I’m not wanting to see a dr, because they will just push an antidepressant on me, which is actually what caused my anxiety years ago. I also never needed it before the anti acids. 

Any input would be great!",2021-09-23 21:15:07

ptxboe,Dealing with angry people at work and having anxiety," 

Hello everyone

I have OCD and an anxiety disorder, I'm very hypersensitive and have a hard time when it comes to confrontation. 

I work in an office where I have to deal with people face to face, by email and phone. 

Most people I deal with face to face are alright and nice, of course there are a few rude angry ones. 

By phone however, I get a lot of phone calls from angry people. Sometimes they are just horrible and rude and scream at me. I always try and be polite and understanding but when people start screaming at me through the phone I just don't know what to do, my coworkers and friends tell me I should either ask them to calm down and say I will not speak to someone disrespecting me or hang up but I just can't do it. 

I just sit there like an idiot on the phone saying things like “I understand” and “That sounds frustrating” while they scream at me. 

I know their anger is not directed at me personally but I just cant help to feel emotionally exhausted after. 

For anyone else working with people or customer service, how do you deal with these situations when people are rude or scream at you?",2021-09-23 20:41:06

All of this rests on the test results of his covid test. I asked my ex to get him tested.  She says he's not in the window to be tested yet. 

 I have no other friends who could drive me. I don't have any family who live near me.  And my anxiety is now through the roof.",2021-09-23 20:05:55
ptw6ci,Back to work anxiety,"My workplace has begun bringing people back to work, and my return date is soon approaching.

It's been a year and a half since I last worked, so I'm definitely feeling anxious about going back. Getting used to that routine all over again, waking up much earlier than I've gotten use to, coming home late. All of that I was fairly conditioned to when this was my normal life, but now it's basically a big lifestyle change that's about to happen.

And I didn't even mention the actual job. 8 hours a day at work again, possibly working evenings and/or weekends (something I've always been opposed to), working alongside other employees (most of which I was never very close with as I don't make friends easily), and having to get use to new and strict covid protocols like wearing a mask for the entire day (something I've never done for that length of time since the longest I've had to wear one might be an hour or two when I go shopping, and even then, it didnt involve me talking to people) and having to check into work beforehand and being cleared to come in.

Some employees I used to work with, I was a bit intimidated by them (either they didn't like me, or just didn't care to acknowledge me), and those are people who are more popular at the job, so I'm nervous about that too.

Basically one giant fear of the unknown where I'll start overthinking things and ""hoping for the best but preparing for the worst"".

Its not entirely like I have so much going on where I'll miss having time at home to do it, but I know how mentally exhausting work can be, especially if there's downtime and/or you have to deal with people a lot during the day whether it be customers or coworkers.",2021-09-23 19:44:19
ptvu2k,How to Stop Rumination?,"How do you stop fixating on an issue...? 

I don't have anything that has stopped this. It's a long standing, big in my life issue that I have to make a decision on eventually. I've been ruminating on it for about 3 years over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over... 

I've come up with 0 answers and am left in further question and attempt to analyze what went wrong, what I do next, what I even am able to do. 

It's on my mind every single day almost every hour. I get a trigger switched and I can't stop thinking about it even more. More research and reading and thinking hasn't helped at all. It's debilitating. It really is. I'm typing this as I sit at my work desk because I can't stop thinking about it.

Distracting oneself works but only until I hit my next trigger which is all the time and everywhere. So then the cycle repeats... I don't know what to do anymore. I'm so stuck... It hurts and I'm so tired.

I'm in therapy and I'm on medication. None of it has stopped the ruminations and I haven't been able to make a choice on anything at all... I really need help... I'm running low on energy and effort and hope.",2021-09-23 19:27:34

I don't know how I slept for a longer duration today and I was woken up by my therapist's call. Ofc i answered in a very sleepy voice and it took me 5-10 mins to gather my thoughts before I could even talk about them. It was fine after that, I had a nice session. But I'm fixating on the initial few minutes when I was sleepy and how 'unprofessional' it was of me and how the therapist would have thought that I was sleeping instead of focusing on therapy for my betterment, which might make her feel that I don't take it seriously. 
I'm also thinking if I should have said anything about the fact that I was sleeping, on the call, would it have made a difference if I would have known that she's okay with it?

ptv7wm,Debilitating Work Anxiety,"I have suffered from GAD for my adult life (now 42).  I have had the same job (varying roles over the years but same general work) for 16+ years.  I have been successful in my performance over the years and my last eval in July was positive.  However, I spend every day waiting to get fired, breaking a sweat when my phone rings, thinking about work all day and night, and I'm starting to loose my strength to fight through this.  I have considered a change in occupation but for financial reasons I can't do anything until at least March 2022.  Even then, I don't know that it's the job that's the true problem. I was having panic attacks long before I got in to this work and I would be walking away from a lot.... I don't want to do that and find out it wasn't the job after all.

I've been to a few psychiatrists, all who refuse to prescribe anything stronger than an SSRI.  I know COVID has made this 100x worse since I no longer go in to an office.  I definitely underestimated the importance of those daily interactions.  I know I should go for a walk, having coffee with a friend, etc etc but tell that to my anxiety brain.  I feel like I'm trapped in this little pressure cooker with no way out.  It distracts me so much I can't get all of my work done during the day.... which leads to anxiety about being behind, and it just sort of feeds on itself from there.  I go to psychotherapy which has been great at understanding where all of this is coming from but I am struggling to exorcise those demons from my present life.  

I have an appointment with my primary dr today to get back on lexapro.  I thought as an introvert I would be happy as ever staying home all the time but it's having the opposite effect and I am loosing my grip on things.  I don't self harm anymore and suicide has never been on the table for me but I don't know where to go from here.  I just want relief from this feeling of dread all of the time.  

I'm not living....at all.  At best I am existing day to day.  Each day is another test that starts with fear of even getting out of bed.  Then dread all morning as I wait to log in to work.  I will feel ok for a few hours working but then the dread sets in again and it just intensifies until I sign off for the day, then I carry that horrible energy with me through the evening.  My boyfriend is very supportive but I know this isn't any fun for him either.  I have great friends and family who have all offered their support and asked how they can help and I don't know what to tell them because I don't know myself.

I'm exhausted by all of this.",2021-09-23 18:55:07

However, my anxiety has recently flaired up immensely due to some life circumstances- my work life has gotten immensely stressful, I'm worried about  the potential market crash on the horizon, my wife just had a miscarriage (very early in the pregnancy but still devastating), and my alcoholic mother who had been sober for 15 months recently relapsed and lied to me several times about it. I went to therapy this week and have scheduled an appointment for next week, but I am really struggling. Normally my anxiety has manifested during times of hardship with work or, more intensely, with my mother. It ranges from general anxiety through the day to intense panic attacks. However, this time around, I am really struggling to get motivated to do anything, which is exacerbating the problem. The only thing that has proven helpful is my friend giving me one of his adderall. I feel like this is based on depression, but I'm not sure.

ptumq5,I finally overcame my vaccine anxiety!,"Yeah, I did it!!

I got my 2nd Pfizer shot yesterday, and all went beyond my expectations. I had a lovely nurse who even helped me get over another phobia of mine and overcome the vaccine anxiety, too.

I tell you, the reality of being vaccinated is so different from the reality you've built up in your head.

For me, the hardest was the 1st shot. I imagined the worst side effects and even death. I was ready to call 112.

But, nothing happened. Lol. In both cases, I had a sore arm for the 1st and 2nd day after the shot.

However, the first week after the first shot was hellish for me, in the sense that I had anxiety attacks and feelings of dread and fear.

I have GAD and I don't react well to taking specific strong drugs or vaccines.

I always think my reactions would be the worst. But it was all in my head.

It doesn't really help that my family is full of anti-vaxxers who truly believe conspiracy theories. But I wanted to do the vax to care for myself and protect myself and those around me.

What helped lessen the side effects was drinking a lot of water (3L a day) and telling myself all the time that I will be OK and there won't be any side effects.

This positive self-talk helped a lot. I also stayed away from social media and stopped reading covid related news that terrifies me.

Please get the shot even if you're extremely anxious like I am. And understand that reality is much scarier in your head than in the real world. Try to find a nurse with empathy and tell her you're anxious. That will really help decrease your anxiety.",2021-09-23 18:26:21

Always begged for a dog and she’s been the light of my life. The thought of losing her just takes the breath out of me.

She’s got other health issues and is on immunosuppressants, I am so scared to lose her. It’s not a huge amount of blood, and she’s not acting exceptionally strange, but it’s a significant enough amount to worry. 

I have no idea how long I have with her anymore, she’s gray now and she pushes through a lot already. I am so scared of losing her. She’s my baby, I love her more than I love myself. I just can’t, back when I was really depressed I used to say that I’d kill myself when she finally dies. And I’m so out of my tree that if I lost her right now, I’d consider it. 

I don’t believe in god, but I’m begging him to take her pain away and give I to me. I don’t care what happens to me, I just don’t want my baby to hurt. 

I don’t know what I will do if the vet ends up telling me this is fatal. That this is it. I can’t think of anything else, I have been crying all night. Just please don’t take my baby away.

Now I can’t go day by day without thinking any little thing that happens in my body is serious and something is wrong with me. I’ve never been a depressed person. I’m usually outgoing, happy, and always just wanted to party and go out and have “fun” with different women never thinking about having something serious with one. Now I’m in this state where I don’t want to go out at all, I just worry about my health all the time and just rather be home googling my symptoms. My mentality has also changed to the fact that I want to settle down and find someone and have kids(being 23 years old) just because I’m thinking I might die some day and I want to leave something behind not leave alone. I hate that I have this mentality now and I really don’t know what to do my doctor thinks I need therapy but I don’t think that’s the solution. What do you guys think?",2021-09-23 12:34:29

Got food poisoning last summer for the first time in my life and had a panic attack for the first time from the feeling of having food poisoning . I havent felt the same since then. I quit smoking weed after that, shortly after started having health anxiety and would end up going to the ER like once every two weeks for like 2 months. The feeling I feel on my chest I don’t know if it’s anxiety at this point or chronic acid reflux. I had a GI appointment booked for September that was made all the way last year cause the wait for specialist is so long and then I moved provinces and couldn’t go to it when the time came. Currently my health card is expired so I can’t go to any doctor to get another appointment made. I don’t feel myself still after a whole year and Its becoming very draining. I hope soon everything will get better and I’m able to see a doctor again soon to get appointments made. Just to be clear I’ve had bloodwork, cardiologists checking over my heart, chest x ray, liver ultrasound and all that came back looking fine n good just haven’t had my stomach checked for chronic acid reflux etc. I feel a mess and tonight more so than ever and having trouble to sleep. I just needed to vent and write things out here.

ptpazf,Cleaned My Room But Still Anxious,"It often gets suggested to clean your room because ""clutter causes stress"" and ""stress breeds anxiety"" but does anyone else feel anxious about their room being cleaned?

When I shared a room with my sister, I would be panicked that she would throw away my things. So it started me in the bad habit of hoarding all sorts of stuff in my room. When I got my own room it only spiraled more and I kept telling myself I was ""a collector"" and I was ""collecting"" things, even though at times, it was literally garbage I picked up from the streets. 

Long story short, I always struggle when it comes time to clean up my room or get rid of things. It took a lot of patience and willpower to get into the mental space of letting things go. I don't get as overwhelmed anymore because I keep my room in check (not letting things pile up *too* high). 

Recently I cleaned my room and finally have access to my window again. My window used to be blocked by stacks of tubs and boxes. 

I thought opening the space would make me feel better because my room looks like a ""proper bedroom"" now. And there's natural light coming in (which is supposed to be good). But looking at my window and the empty space around it makes me anxious. I get a stab in my chest whenever I look at the empty floor and I avert my eyes whenever I see my window. I can't even sleep properly because I know this area of my room is tidy. Am I missing the comfort of the mess? Or is my window stressing me out? Is the natural light something that takes adjusting to? I don't have problems with any other windows. So I'm left feeling uncomfortable in my own room. 

I just have been wondering if anyone else ever feels anxious after cleaning their room? Or their space? Is it the change that makes you feel anxious? Or do you generally feel less anxious when things have been cleaned or tidied?

(i am seeking a professional's opinion IRL as well. i just thought it'd be interesting to know if anyone else has felt something similar after cleaning their room)",2021-09-23 12:04:22

Fast forward to 1st period and I finally decide to take my inhaler, no relief. I start panicking a little bit more because it was getting harder to breathe and now my heart rate is through the roof.

I go to 2nd period, probably looking like I just died and came back to life *barely* annnnddddd that's when I notice my *THROAT* is tightening, at this point I asked to go to the office and once I got done there, I couldn't breathe at all. The nurse comes down and she's just terrified and starts saying she is going to call 911 and obviously my anxiety went through the roof causing me to hyper ventilate EVEN MORE, she's trying to reach my dad through his work phone (he works at Amazon so it has to go to someone first.) And she's just threatening to call 911, I'm SUPER lightheaded and decide I'm going to take two more puffs LIKE THE IDIOT IT I AMMM annndddd the only thing to happen is my heart rate is through the roof, I start panicking and eventually my whole body was numb and I passed out.

Woke up in the ER and found out I just had a panic attack, I mistook a panic attack for an asthma attack. I'm still really freaked out by it because I genuinely thought I may have a heart attack while in the nurses office. I am diagnosed with anxiety and it's really really bad, but the thing is I've never had a panic attack as bad as that one. I didn't even know what caused it? That's why I was so confused.

I'm having problems being functional in school because I can't talk to people without locking up and feeling a rush of anxiety and I have panic attacks for absolutely no reason. I was doing group work in my Japanese class and I had to leave class to pop an Ativan (I got prescribed this for panic attacks). Same thing happened the next day, and I had to leave class to take anxiety medication (hydroxizine this time). Then because hydroxizine knocks me out for the whole day, I didn't go to the next class, and my class after that I was too anxious to go to. I cannot be around people without feeling panicky and I sweat profusely. Sometimes my back is drenched with sweat after class because I'm anxious during the entire class for pretty much no reason. and now it's making me depressed because I have no one to talk to.  can anyone with these problems tell me how I can deal with these problems. PS I already see a therapist but I don't get to go to therapy often because I don't have a lot of time to. I also can't go to social gatherings such as school clubs without having panic attacks.

You see my freshman year back in 2017 I had to take a medical leave bc of my ocd and anxiety so now I’m graduating a year later. Anyways because of my ocd and anxiety I never really networked that much or did any informational interviews. I first landed my first ever internship. I mean I was a research assistant but that was such low commitment. The way that people talk about post grad life is so scary and it’s terrifying to me that after this I’m done with college forever. I wish my college experience could have been better but it is what it is. Just like the way that people talk about post grad terrifies the living shit out of me and post grad I’ll be living with my parents who have a terrible relationship and there’s lots of screaming and overall a terrible environment. I feel so constrained at home and free away at college but I’m broke and I can’t afford anything. It’s just the way that people talk about aging too is so depressing. I will be 23 in June and like that is so scary because I don’t look or act 23. In just full of so many anxieties. I know it’s normal but I’m scared. I’m scared shitless that I’m gonna end up jobless.

I believe the medicine was only hiding my symptoms and once I got off it was like I never took it at all. 

I have also had an increase in asthma attacks where I had to use my nebulizer regularly for the past 4 days. It does work but It feels weird when I breathe.

ptn3he,Can anyone give thoughts on what's wrong with me,"I've had some anxiety my whole life but my anxiety got much worse than it ever has been in summer of 2020 because I developed constant tinnitus and didn't know why and I tend to have fear of the unknown so I was worried something was very wrong with me.  Then college came around and I had one of the worst and most stressful semesters I've ever had, so that made the anxiety even worse. Luckily I ended up finding out why I had tinnitus, I was diagnosed with a neurological disorder called visual snow syndrome which caused the tinnitus, and it also gives me some floaters and static in my vision. Finally knowing what was wrong with me decreased my anxiety about that a lot, but my anxiety was still horrible from school. All of a sudden I started having all problems with me that I feel are linked to the anxiety. It started with random abdominal pain and bad stomach issues like constipation, etc at least one or 2 weeks per month, and I never used to have problems like this. I have constant sinus pressure all around my nose and by my eyes. Things just keeps getting worse. It seems like bad anxiety about 1 or 2 things has stemmed into a full on anxiety disorder and nowadays I have have random anxiety attacks where my heart rate goes up and I get anxious, sometimes even for seemingly no reason. 

Since around March/April or so of this year I've had stiff joints, it started with my fingers and feet, then neck, back, and knees all became stiff, but the worst affected are probably my neck and fingers.  I've also been having random hot flashes on and off for over the last like 2 months, but I also remember I got a random hot flash one time last year when I was anxious. I just started getting them a lot recently though and I feel like it might be related to the anxiety. I think it would make sense since I'm anxious almost 24/7 now.

I'm not sure if these stiffness symptoms are from the anxiety or from some sort of Arthritis or something so I was wondering if anyone on here had any thoughts. I'm currently seeing a rheumatologist about it and am in the process of getting it diagnosed but I wanted some opinions before I find out what's up because I've just been worried about it. I'm only 19 so symptoms like this are pretty weird for my age. These symptoms are making my anxiety even worse than it already was since I get very anxious when I have something wrong with me that I don't know what it is.",2021-09-23 09:30:13

i have horrible health anxiety and ocd, which leads to obsessively looking up my symptoms and worrying about them over and over until i bring myself to a panic attack. my health anxiety is usually over the chest pains i get from anxiety... they come from nowhere and because i am literally obsessing over them i can't stop thinking about it and it won't go away. because i'm so hyper focused on it, it gets worse and ill get nauseous, light headed, have palpitations, or just straight up have a panic attack.

i've tried meditation— doesn't work, i can't focus, my chest gets heavier— breathing exercises, trying to distract myself (practically impossible because of my aforementioned obsessive thinking), drinking water, relaxing my muscles.... nothing has worked.

Just some name calling and invasion of personal space to begin with. I snapped at him once during my third last week rooming with him to which he apologized, but on the very last day was when he was the most aggressive. He called me stupid when we played one last round of league, kind of horsed around with me briefly like he was a fighting game character and put his hand on my shoulder with a condescending smirk when he saw me off. This was all on top of me struggling with a very stressful job but quitting it on that final day when I moved out.

I didn't think much of it right at the time, but then I realized he had kind of been bullying me for the last three or four weeks I was rooming with him. Now I'm filled with anger and shame because I was 29 and allowed someone to act like this to me without having established firm boundaries.

I work the opening shift at a fast food restaurant, so i made sure to call early this evening, well before closing time. i posted my shift on my restaurant’s app for someone else to take up, and called to let one of my managers that i won’t make it for my shift tomorrow- and let her know that i don’t have any of my coworkers’ contact information (except doe one person, who i already knew wouldn’t be able to cover for me) (because i’m too anxious to ask them for it hahaha). she sent me a list of everybody’s phone numbers (which i really appreciate because she really didn’t have to do that for me!). Only, i realized that i dont actually know ANYBODY on the list, except for the people who ALREADY WORK THE OPENING SHIFT WITH ME 😭 i already feel bad enough trying to contact people at 8:00 pm, but trying to ask somebody i don’t even know to get up early enough to be there before sunrise and do my job for me feels like the most selfish thing i could possibly do. 

i can’t just go to work anyway- if i’m sick with something contagious it wouldn’t be fair to possibly infect all the food i come in contact with and all my coworkers. I can’t ask anybody to cover for me- but i also can’t NOT ask somebody to cover for me, because we’re so short staffed as it is. no matter what i do, i feel like the bad guy and i don’t know how to handle the situation. worse, i can’t even just try to get some rest because i’m too busy overthinking this whole thing!!!

i try to make myself feel better by telling myself that at least i called in way ahead of time instead of at the last minute, or worse, not at all (as some of my coworkers are prone to doing)- but i still feel overwhelming guilt.

ptm47s,How do I make friends?,"I'm 25, going to college and have amazingly awful social anxiety. I have lived completely alone no where near family for about a year now since I moved for school and am crazy lonely.

I wasn't always crazy socially anxious. My social anxiety really came about when I was 16. I had encephalitis which basically erased my memory and I had to start over new.

When I recovered and went back to school I regained friends I had made before I got sick, but in the 7 years since I graduated highschool my old friends have moved away, lost contact, and my social anxiety grew and grew, until I couldn't socialize with anyone outside of family and even have trouble with them.

For about 7 years I haven't made any friends, and haven't socialized with any in about 4 years...

It may sound odd, but I honestly don't know how to make friends. I don't know how to socialize. I don't know how to start and keep a conversation, or join in on one.

Oddly though, at work or school I can seem to BS around my anxiety with classmates or coworkers or customers and have a short explanatory conversation about a topic at hand no problem. But when it comes to social communication I have no clue...

When and how do I start a conversation? How do you continue a conversation? And how in the hell do you set up a time outside of school or work to socialize with someone?

Simple human nature it seems, but I must be some kind of bloody alien who has no clue how any of this works.

And most importantly....

ptlw1z,I feel guilty for needing/asking for as needed anxiety meds.,"My anxiety is pretty bad some days when a stressful event happens. My heart rate spikes and I start feeling sick like I have the flu. Headache, temperature, stuffy nose, sore throat, nausea. It used to be panic attacks but it’s gone through whole different stages. My therapist think I need something like Xanax or Klonopin. So I go to a psychiatrist and he prescribes me Mirtazapine which will help in the long run but my situation I’m in causes me to be in fight mode 24/7. Anyways, I feel guilty for needing it like my issues I’m going through aren’t big and I’m just making my anxiety up in my head. I feel like I’m asking for too much if I were to ask to be prescribed an as needed medication. How can I change this mindset?",2021-09-23 08:16:10
ptlokj,Anyone taking medications without simple effects?,"I’ve always managed to deal with my anxiety and ocd through therapy alone but during covid I’ve really hit a low place and am struggling.  My kids are back to school (not vaccine age yet) and I am becoming really germaphobic and difficult to be around...as well as being miserable.  

I’m switching to a therapist that specializes in ocd treatment and they brought up the idea of medication along with the therapy.  

I’ve been resistant to daily medication for fear of side effects.  I’m curious if anyone has managed to take a medication for any appreciable length of time and not had side effects?  The sexual stuff is a bummer but I’m most concerned with weight gain as I suffer from some body image issues.",2021-09-23 08:03:13
ptlhnq,I fear life to the point where I don't really want to be here anymore?,"I am a genuine loser. Any time I'm hit with a minor inconvenience that my health or life could be compromised, my thoughts seem to default to self mutilation. I don't even want to know how I would react if something genuinely catastrophic were to happen.

An example would be like last week; my new, nice dentist told me my wisdom teeth are rotting and I really ought to get them out. I already fear dentists due to childhood trauma with lots of cavities and an unsympathetic, condescending pediatric dentist, but I'm even more scared of something as invasive as pulling out teeth. I know I must get them out before the end of the year.

Most people survive with no problems, everyone gets it done. A very small fraction seem to die post op, yet I'm convinced it will happen to me, which is why I've delayed it for so long. I keep going down the Dr. Google rabbit hole and it drives me to tears. I can't comfort myself with the fact that chances of dying are slim to none; as long as they're not zero, I will panic.

Some times it drives me so crazy that at the end of the day I'm just tired. It's so exhausting having to constantly be on high alert and convincing myself that life will come and get me when I least expect it. I fear that I will experience ""the worst case scenario"" so much that I'd rather die than prolong the torment my brain loves putting me through.

The whole wisdom tooth thing is the only current example I can think of that sent me down a spiral, but in reality almost every stressful event seems to cause this. My COVID shots, my sister not responding to my messages for more than a few days, Hell, even some mornings when I hop into the car to go to work, I sometimes convince myself I'll get into a crash and die.

None of this is valid and it might even make some people angry, but I needed to let it out. Sorry.",2021-09-23 07:51:27
ptlhgu,Anxiety or a genuine cardiac issue?,"I have a history of both anxiety and some mild cardiac problems. But this was a little concerning and I don't know which it is. I'm okay now but was this an issue?

The other night I was relaxing in the bathtub reading a book. I was so happy and relaxing and calm. But while I was laying in the tub in the warm water, my heart started thumbing really hard. I was calm and reading a book, thoroughly enjoying myself. I didn't feel anxious. I had no anxious thoughts. Of course, anxiety can sometimes come out of nowhere with no discernable cause, but I didn't feel distressed. Just a bit concerned that it wasn't going away, but I wouldn't say more worried or stressed about it than anyone would be. It also wasn't a racing heart. Just a big thumping. If anything it was more slow than fast

BOOM. ... BOOM. ... BOOM.

Has this happened to anyone else? Did it have to do with the bath? It went away after I got out. If it was related to the bath, is that normal or would that only happen if there is a heart issue? It was very odd.",2021-09-23 07:51:08

ptl0le,I Don't Know What's Wrong,"Before anyone asks:
Yes I am taking medication/switched medication
Yes I am connected with a licensed therapist

I've been feeling very off since last year around Christmas time. One day, I just felt ""off,"" no other way to explain it. Ever since then, I've become consumed about how I am feeling, constantly. I am always checking how I feel, and perceive things. This ""checking"" comes both consciously and without conscious thought.  When it started, it got worse and worse. Ultimately winding me up in a heap of anxiety and depression. I was worried I had a brain tumor, was developing schizophrenia, dementia, etc. I had thoughts that I might have seizures or pass out. I even felt dizzy at some point. For a while, after receiving medication and therapy, I felt ok. But some days are worse than others. This ""off"" feeling has never REALLY 100% gone away. Sometimes my head feels full, numb, and it is hard for me to understand exactly what is happening around me at some points. I have sudden shifts in symptoms as well. Some days, I am OCD with sound (the fan in my bedroom makes noise, and I cannot sleep as a result if I am feeling this way that day), other days I feel too tired, etc etc.  The never ending question plagues me... am I sick? Will this ever f***ing end? Sorry for the crase language. 

One other point. Everything just feels off. I know where I am but at the same time, I feel confused about where I am. My spacial awareness and concept of time are off. The days float by and I cant remember fine details of the day before. Im more forgetful.

Long post from a long time anxiety suffer. I have been at my current job for 9 years and I gave them the heads up that I was a finalist for a job on Tuesday and signed my offer letter for the job this morning. This is a dream type job to get me an industry that I want to get into, able to work from home, and something new for me. It also pays more, gives me room for growth, and will help with my marriage.

Problem is..... I feel super guilty for leaving. To put it in perspective this would be like an accountant leaving in the middle of tax season. I know this is the right move for me and my family, but I know I am going to burn some bridges and be looked down upon once I start telling others I have two weeks left either tomorrow or Friday. I start the new job 10/11. My wife and others say I shouldn't feel guilty for leaving since I have not been promoted in the 9 years I have been with the company, others in different department don't treat me well, I do most of the work, and my salary has gone up only about 7k since I started. The job is causing me enough anxiety and boring for me at this point, so I know deep down it is the right move, but yet I feel bad. I know I am going to leave a huge hole and it is going to be struggle for my boss to do what I did.

The anxiety is crippling. I can't sleep, I feel like my blood pressure is sky high, my stomach in knots. Why do I have issues with how people are going to perceive me? These next few weeks are going to be so tough from an anxiety perspective.

ptini3,i hate this cycle,"i really need to know if anyone relates to this cuz it's been driving me crazy. my anxiety tends to cycle a lot- think about a problem and get anxious, research about it and get more anxious, get info confirming my worries are invalid and calm down, but get anxious all over again thinking of the possibility.

for example, i have bad health anxiety, especially with my mental health. i have a bad fear of getting mental disorders- the stigma, the scary experiences and damages on my life that could happen just freak the fuck out of me.

feeling really down and confused -> look up mental disorders -> ""oh, am i bipolar?"" -> google bipolar symptoms and see what i relate to -> get anxious when i relate to something -> get anxious thinking about the future and what might happen now im convinced i have it, continue researching -> find out ""oh hey adhd is similar, guess im in the clear"" -> calm, relief -> out of nowhere (from hours to days later), ""oh no, but what if my case is different? what if i really am?? -> repeat from googling

i've never, ever had any sort of ""high-feeling mania"" but i convinced myself i had it. and when i read things about similarities i'd calm down, but then the worry would always crop back up, even when the proof is against it.

this also happened earlier this year with something else, my anxiety was really bad and i thought i was developing schizophrenia because i had a bad trip off weed last year and i read studies and testimonies about how weed can induce/trigger schizophrenia. i was shook at first- but then i realized i don't suffer from any psychotic symptoms, so i calmed down- but my brain went, ""but what if it ends up happening in the future??"" and back to worrying.

lately i've been anxious about a hacking incident. im not sure who or how long but someone at the very least had remote access to one of my computers. i wiped/reset all my devices to get rid of it after seeing some alarming signs on my laptop and gaming PC. someone was deleting games and bookmarks, my internet would sometimes get slow etc... i thought i was going crazy or paranoid, because before i wiped my antivirus didnt pick up anything, but then i started getting nasty emails sent to me after the resets, angry about me wiping everything and telling me how ""therapy will never work for me"" (something i would never talk about to anyone other than my parents, they were listening to me). ever since then, even though i know no one is on my devices anymore, i keep researching about trojans and looking for other people's experiences with them. what were they using my computer for when i wasnt there??? how long did they have access??? is this someone i know?? what more do they know about me?? my parents saw the emails and told me that now whoever this person is doesnt have access to my devices anymore and i shouldnt worry, but im still anxious. i keep researching and then acting all calm, and then getting anxious all over again and researching and researching like it's going to help or confirm anything. i cant take it. (and yes, i once again was anxious that i was going delusional, but this genuinely wasn't the case lol)

it's exhaaauuusting. i hate it. does anyone else have worrying cycles like these, where you get anxious about something on and off even when u have proof everything will be okay and that ur being irrational?? its maddening",2021-09-23 05:04:47

Being told to calm down and that I don't know that I have anxiety or what having anxiety entails only frustrates me because I'm very familiar with anxiety and It's tormented me all my life and I've gone through it trying to pretend that everything is okay when I'm crumbling apart at the seems.

The best way I can describe the feeling is like someone is tickling the same spot for around 10-30 minutes  at a time up to around 5-10 times a day. The feeling is usually pleasant and it sorta reminds me of a mild way I used to feel in that spot when I was high. After a while it sort of feels like a tension headache, without the pain. 

 I mentioned this with my doctor, along with my other symptoms, and they mentioned it was all just anxiety. But this feeling has been going on so long I don't know if anyone else has experienced this before. 

I no longer feel as scared and as anxious before, but this symptom is consistently there.",2021-09-23 04:26:27
pthu67,Propanolol for anxiety,"My psychiatrist recommended propanolol for my anxiety and panics, but I’m wrapping my brain around whether this actually has any anxiolytic properties besides preventing heart rate increase. When I get anxious yes my heart rate is a bit out of control but the thing that sends me into a panic is feeling sick, which often happens when I’m anxious. I like that nausea isn’t a common side effect like it is for so many other meds, but I still feel I need to rewire my brain instead of just not having panic attacks. I’m hoping for an effect similar to taking Valium but without all the addiction problems. To those who have tried it, how was it? Better than antidepressants/benzos or worse?",2021-09-23 04:20:35
pthgkd,Breathing issues for over a week,"I'm sorry but I feel so alone. No one seems to understand the chronic health anxiety I have. This time it's really taking over my life.

A week or so ago I got a really awful sharp shooting pain in my left calf, the pain that makes you feel sick.

It carried on for a few days, then it turned into aches and cramps for a week, and has only just started to feel better. But I feel like I can't get enough air in this last week and that I have chest pains.

Logic me says: you're a runner, you have an active job, that's why your legs are bad, you have probably sprained the tendons. As for the breathing, you're panicking as you think you have a DVT.

Panic me says: I've got a DVT and now it is a pulmonary embolism on my chest and oh my god what do I do, I should phone the doctor, go to a and e, keep checking my legs for redness and swelling, oh shit why does my chest now hurt. And it is a never ending cycle....

The pain in the leg started on the 12th September. It's blows subsided to an ache now and again, cramp if I go on a long walk or drive. But I've had breathing issues since then and still now. As I'm still panicking.

I hate myself, I hate being this way, and I hate the way it interrupts my life. Feeling really really down and just rubbish right now.

pth8od,Hopeful That GAD Will Go Away,"I am hopeful that GAD will go away it just takes time and a lot of patience. I am a Teenager with GAD who has had this disorder for a good 8 to 9 months. I also possibly have depression. I am barely beginning treatment because I only discovered that I had this 2 months ago. 

My daily anxiety for me is will I ever be okay, anything bad going to happen at school, should I be scared. I try everyday to keep walking through and ignore those thoughts. And you know what somedays for me helps somedays really not. But I will say this for the will I ever be okay spot, I am starting to accept my disorder emotionally, before I couldn't accept that this happend because I was scared that this will haunt me for the rest of my life, the thing is... you won't.. With the proper treatment and lifestyle choices like exercising and not smoking or drink caffeine etc. I believe it can go away, and even if that isn't a reality based on reddit posts I have seen in my rant post it made me hopeful that even if this doesn't go away with treatment it basically goes away, kind of like having good and bad days. I am not a medical professional, probably do not listen to what I have said but in my own experience of researching and talking with people I believe you can overcome GAD and lead back to a normal life with maybe a few hiccups in the road on some days.

One of the reasons why I got GAD and Depression was from worrying about something that happend at school and the fighting going on at my school, not only that sparked the fire at the end of my anxious moment I caused more flames in the fire by saying negative things about myself, like why am I worth this, you should flush your game down the toliet. I developed a negative mindset that probably contributed to this disorder. 

I worried about the school and the fights going on for a good 3 months until I started worrying about my illness not going away, that's when I started my search after 4 months and searching on reddit for answers on my vacation. I finally put the picture together that my anxiety caused everything that I was feeling. 

I went to the Doctors on my 3rd month to see what is wrong, after 3 blood tests, countless medications, kidney doctors, CT scan of my back and kidney. The Doctor didn't give us an answer because everything was normal... except with one thing.. enlarged spleen.. 

Overtime the Doctors just figured it was mono, and that everything will be normal but nope! I still had back ache symptoms, memory issues, fatigue. Overtime I felt like nobody was believing what I had to say.. Nobody took me seriously, but I wasn't going to let that discourage me.. After looking into 30 diseases, infections, and a lot of trial and error. I stumbled upon a fourm post on reddit talking about General Anxiety Disorder. And that post blew my mind because I had the exact same symptoms as he had! 

I cried on that very day because I finally got an actual answer not some answer that is sketchy or untrue. And my crying actually gave me hope and caused my memory to return to normal for atleast 2 whole days! 

Now we are at the present day, I am going to talk with my Doctor about my disorder to see what options in terms of recovery are, but I am going to start Group Therapy and one on one therapy in the upcoming months. I am also trying to sleep more, eat more healthy and exercise more.  I also had a great support talk system during those 8 months with my teachers. 

I am Hopeful that not only this will go away but that this will make me even stronger than I was before. 

Thank you for reading my story and thank you Reddit for being the one to answer.",2021-09-23 03:51:11
pth0nz,Advice,"So this is my 2nd time posting on here. I felt I needed to come back to ask for advice. So recently my doctor upped my medication because I’ve grown a tolerance and the medication no longer makes me feel like I did before. So moving forward, it’s helped a little bit but i had a venting conversation with my significant other about how I don’t want to be on meds anymore and I don’t want to rely on them anymore I just want to feel normal. To be honest it just almost feels impossible for me. My mind is always running thinking about “what if’s” and “worry”. The reason I’m asking for advice is because my barber pointed out today while getting my haircut I have a small bald spot. Rewind a few years back, I had a bald spot on the back of my head due to stress and overthinking, eventually the hair grew back but today it hit me hard again, I started to worry and feel self conscious 
How did/do some of you overcome this feeling? How did you stop worrying and over thinking? Did you get off of meds because you overcame this feeling? Any advice helps because I really just want to be normal again.",2021-09-23 03:40:31

ptfopx,"GAD, is it really this bad?","Diagnosed GAD for 3 years now but it’s been most of my adult life I’ve suffered with symptoms. I’m in my twenties. I was doing well for so long, but I’m having a rougher than usual time in my life right now which is exacerbating my anxiety. It’s coming up a year since my fiancé died, our son has just started nursery and Ive just gone back to work. SO many life changes, so it’s really not surprising. I take 150mg pregabalin 3 times a day but lately I don’t feel like it’s enough or working. 
I had a panic attack for the first time in a year last week. Since then, even taking my meds I’ve just felt violently ill and on edge. My whole chest is heavy. My face is numb, like the right side of my face just feels droopy, though it isn’t, it just feels it? My eye is blurry. I’m pins and needle-y all over. My heart is pounding. I can’t sleep, I feel sick, and dizzy. 
You know when you’ve had a panic attack and you’re in that fight or flight state and just feel like general shit for an hour or so? I feel like that. But it’s been days now. It’s worse at night. 
I thought about going to the doctor but I don’t know if they can help as I’m already on meds, and I’ve found in the past as soon as you mention ‘anxiety’ they don’t take you seriously or think you’re a hypochondriac. 
I am sure I am just stressed at the minute, and it will pass. But can heightened anxiety REALLY make you feel this awful? I’ve felt so ‘normal’ for so long I’ve forgotten the physical affect it can have on you. I panicked myself into another panic attack (lol) earlier because my brain was convinced it absolutely couldn’t JUST be anxiety and I was having a stroke, so that was a laugh.

I either felt just as bad, or I felt empty. No sadness - no happiness, just... plain nothing. 

I didn't want to take them anymore, and quited them several years ago and I was doing kinda rough in the first few months, but after that I was doing pretty okay. 


Now my life's pretty good actually, I have a full time job, a girlfriend - a flat and pets together

ptey3l,Stream of Consciousness writing can help during periods of intermediate anxiety,"Thankfully, my my medication works very well in reducing my anxiety -- but I do remember having exceptional anxiety that prevented me from sleeping. Almost an anxiety of being asleep, it was so bad that I would force myself into exhaustion by either staying up until the sun came up or exercising to the point of exhaustion. I did find, however, that stream of consciousness writing helped immensely. Not with sleep, but in calming my mind down because I could see my thoughts in writing, in real-time. I didn't know this was an actual technique, I just tried it on a whim -- ended up writing for 4 straight hours at real-time speed and finished just over 31 pages of internal dialogue. It helped to read it during my more rational non-anxious states so I could analyze my thought patterns and identify what thoughts make me anxious.

ptcham,A senior colleague blames all his mistakes on my colleague - need advice,"I (M 30) work in the strategy department of an internationally renowned holding group. And a year ago, this colleague from the Sustainability department (let's call him Frank) started a Sustainability project to get positive scores from the sustainability auditors. 

Frank is in his fifties and has been working for this holding group for about ten years, moving from one position to another. He's a bit of a rascal, suspected since my arrival of embezzling funds... nevertheless, he's still there and it seems curious on several levels...

Anyway, Frank, one year after starting the sustainability positioning of the Group with his brand new department, is starting to receive ratings from the auditors. And these ratings are not good at all. Worse than that, they were better before he started his project. Only, rather than taking responsibility for these positioning errors, twice this month he has emailed my colleague in the strategy department with all the executive members of the Group in CC and accused her of being responsible for these bad ratings, because ""she is responsible for the website where the Sustainability content is published, and it is based on this content that the auditors establish a rating"" (which is not wrong). However, the content of the site is delivered by Frank and his team and he did not mention this detail in the complaint emails he sent. 

From our point of view, it is clear that he is responsible and that he is just trying to clear his name. But we don't know what to do. We know that he has strong links with these executive members of the company and my colleague would love to do something about it but is afraid of losing her job.

If I must give a presentation, I will have anxiety until the presentation is over because I hate public speaking.

ptc0rx,I spoke with my doctor about the panic attacks I've been having for the last three and a half days. She prescribed me PRN Buspar. I've spoken to patients while in psych wards about Buspar and I was under the impression that it's something that needs to be taken regularly?,"Now I'm anxious about starting that because I'm worried it won't work and I already feel like I'm going crazy.  My nurse will be dropping by in a little bit with the Buspar.  If I understood my doctor correctly, she wants me to take it as needed for anxiety flare-ups like this one.  However, previous research I've done online and experiences with many patients taking it during my 13 psych hospitalizations has led me to believe that this is something that needs to be taken regularly to reap its benefits.

Have any of you taken it PRN?  Have any of you noticed improvement with it, either taken as needed or on a regular basis?  How long did it take for you to notice a difference?",2021-09-22 22:36:24

ptbomi,Teen regretting job decisions,"I was looking for my first ever job at 2 grocery stores and the first one I accepted and did the orientation and everything but quit shortly after because the other place offered me a job and that one at the time was better in my head.

My coworkers are really cool they're mostly around my age but the owner is an a hole and kind of scary, most managers except for a few are decent and the hours aren't really what I was looking for. They even tried getting me to work for free with volunteer hours.

What should I do? I lied about leaving the first place saying that my parents were separating and I won't be living in the area anymore (really stupid I know) I also turned down another offer after quitting this one. I'm so anxious right now.

The day before I was having nonstop thoughts about the mind it's self, I tend to overthink things a lot. The next day however, I don't know what it is but, my mind felt slow. I woke up and began questioning where is everyone? At school the classrooms felt empty as it felt that daily someone would go missing. Aside from my dogs and cat no one was at home. I even played some games online and that even felt empty. I felt alone, but my mind was the strangest of all that. It was harder to put together thoughts, and make images in my head. It felt like I couldn't think straight no matter how hard I tried. Thus has been going on for days now and I'm lost on what do.

pt8ua1,had a fit of uncontrollable crying yesterday - this is happening a few times a month and I dont know what it is or what to do.,"female, 27, i work in IT and have been working from home due to covid stuff. 

I see a therapist who is able to prescribe me medication - i take 60 mg of Prozac every day and 1.5 mg of Vraylar at night. I also am prescribed lorazepam (1 mg) for panic attacks (which I have been taking quite often). 

Yesterday i was working at home and started crying. a lot. out of nowhere. I have had horrible anxiety and panic attacks for the entire past year after a traumatic experience (DWI w/ sleep medication), but the last few months have been something else. I find myself having a full-blown breakdown like a few times a month. Its to the point where I am trying to start keeping track of when this happens - I dont think they are related to my period/hormones but I have no clue. I dont know what is happening to me.

Yesterday was especially strange because it seemed to have come out of nowhere - I was listening to a podcast and i just started fully bawling and pulling my hair out. I had to ask if i could clock out early. walked to a convenience store and bought alcohol.

my boyfriend comforted and stayed with me - we ordered pizza. I told him i didn't wanna be around anymore and now I am regretting saying that to him. I don't want him to be worried and he is depressed too.

I see my therapist again in a few weeks i just needed to get this out somewhere. i might post a few other places too. I'm taking a sick day today and i feel guilty but im terrified of this happening again. i dont know if its a panic attack or what it is. but it makes me now want to be around anymore. do other people deal with this too?",2021-09-22 20:05:04

pt8a0l,My job is tearing me apart mentally.,"Long read ahead. So I work at a pharmacy. A very busy, very understaffed corporate pharmacy. So after the pandemic things really got out of hand, we can't keep up with your prescription count anymore, on top of all our daily tasks as technicians. We also have a verbally abusive pharmacist who ""can do no wrong"" because if he gets fired corporate will have to close our pharmacy due to having no other ""manager"" (He doesn't actually hold the title of manager) That we need to legally operate. We might have 3 techs on a good day. Usually only 2. We have a drive through and front counter so that's where we're stuck as the pharmacist tries to force one person to work both to touch the mountain of filling scripts but due to our customer count it's not feasible. We never slow down. And customers are extremely rude and not understanding. I've been cursed at, screamed at, belittled, etc. All for stuff I can't control. Best I can do is get your stuff ready now you're here. Yes I know you dropped it off yesterday but it is what it is. So now we're drowning in customer complaints all while the district manager sends emails demanding we address them, demanding we do these tasks despite you know, two people. Demanding better customer service, etc. I have panic attacks badly, but can't even step out to take a moment to calm down and breathe. Instead I just help customers with shaky hands and tears running down my face. I've applied to at least five other places to get a job, but they haven't gotten back. I'm at my wits end. My life is consumed by the anxiety of work, the dread of having to go back, I worry constantly about work. I've saved up a good bit of money, but I'm hesitant to quit and have to dip into it until I can get another job, but I don't seem to have a choice. What should I do? Should I just grit my teeth and wait it out? I woke up with the worst panic attack of my life this morning, and I just keep getting worse.",2021-09-22 19:37:04
pt85vz,Am I a failure for quitting my job suddenly?,"This is really hard for me to share because I am almost paralyzed with guilt and shame right now. 

I have always struggled with my mental health. I grew up in a very dysfunctional, abusive family who I still live with today. I started cutting when I was 12 and then used weed and alcohol to deal with depression and anxiety in my early 20s. I have was on antidepressants for a couple of years but I don't take them anymore. 

I graduated from law school in 2019. The only reason I went to law school was because my parents said it would be a good idea and I didn't know what else to do with my life. Before law school, I had changed my major many times and had failed out of nursing school. 

In 2020, I couldn't find a job and was still living at home. I started using weed a lot more and experienced full blown manic psychosis. I was forcibly hospitalized 3 times (the police had to take me) before I snapped out of it. This led to my current diagnosis of bipolar disorder. 

I was released from the hospital at the end of 2020 and started applying to jobs. But the problem was, I became a completely different person after psychosis. My anxiety and depression increased catastrophically. I felt like I lost my personality and my soul. 

The first job I got, I quit in less than 2 months because I was miserably anxious. I didn't feel too bad about it because it was an area of law that I wasn't really interested in. 

Which brings me to my current situation. I was hired by a very reputable law firm about 1.5 months ago. I thought this time things would work out because it was a different area of law (personal injury). Suffice to say, I failed spectacularly. I hated the nature of the work and I became a social outcast at the office despite trying to be polite and courteous to everybody. 

Coworkers started gossiping about me because I was  so quiet and because my office was next to reception (where they would often talk about me) so I could sometimes hear them.

 Each email, phone call, and interaction overwhelmed me. I fantasized about suicide constantly, and took benzos every morning and night. I could never stop thinking about the work and always felt anxious and overwhelmed. Each day I thought about quitting but I told myself to push through for the sake of my career and  because of the student loans. 

But it became unbearable and I quit 2 days ago. I made up a bullshit excuse and asked to leave as soon as possible. They told me to I could leave after I writing transition memos so we never discussed what my official last day would be. I finished all the memos in one day and left without saying goodbye to anybody because my body and mind were screaming at me to escape the place. On my last day (yesterday) I broke my years long streak and cut myself in the office. After leaving, I emailed the boss and told him I had finished the memos and would not be coming in again. I left without saying goodbye to anybody because I didn't have the courage to face them and pretend to be okay.

I feel mortified about my behavior. I left in the most unprofessional way possible and I know this will hurt my reputation in my small town's legal community. I am filled with anxiety at imagining what my coworkers are saying about my abrupt departure. 

I also have accepted that law is not the right career for me. And so now, I am left with nothing. I am 27 and living at home. I feel like the biggest fucking failure for quitting and for how I handled the situation. I feel like things will never get better and that I am the biggest fuck-up on the planet. 

I guess I just wanted to vent and share my story. Thanks to anyone that took the time to read through it all.",2021-09-22 19:31:17

For example I know she will be doing drugs but if she doesn’t tell me what she’s doing I’ll be pissed off, but I know if the roles were reversed I’d probably hide from her so she doesn’t get annoyed. Why am I like this. I fully know it’s my problem and stuff but I just can’t break out of this cycle, whatever it is. How can I relax more and not let my anxiety run loose, I don’t want to spoil her time.

pt7xzr,The definition of social anxiety by me,"Last night/early this morning I woke up to smell of burning, and searched my house for the cause. I couldn't find anything, so I got back in bed for another hour. The smell got worse, and I couldn't deny that something was burning, somewhere. 

I searched our house again, and looked out the windows. At last, I looked out the correct window and saw the yard of our neighbors on fire, right where it bordered our garden. 

Rushing outside, I saw a log that borders the garden on fire, inside the log mostly, with lots of smoke. So I ran back in the house for a bucket, turned on the faucet in the front yard, and started dumping water on the fire. It took me 45 minutes to douse it enough for the embers to stop smoldering.

Once I determined it was completely out, I made my way back to bed. But first, I wrote a note to the neighbors telling them about the fire, and left it in their mail slot. It was now 4 AM, and rather than wake them up, I spent almost 2 hours stopping this fire by myself. And this is my definition of social anxiety.",2021-09-22 19:19:46

pt7m9q,✨Goodmorning ✨🦋you are not alone 🦋,"Goodmorning everyone and happy hump dayyyyyy! 

Let’s wake up happy and kick anxiety in the ass today. Get up out of bed and go to work or school today with nothing on your mind but positivity! No matter how hard it is, try it. Think of all the things that make you happy and think of everything you live for. You can even live for yourself and that’s totally okay. 

Stop sitting and waiting for something or someone to make you happy. You will be waiting forever. Find your own happiness. Anxiety tends to make us feel miserable but we need to stop that. We have to keep our selves distracted and look for the positive out come of this. We come out stronger than ever every single day. 


You don’t know the power of your mind till you try it. You’re more than just an “anxiety ball” (i used to say I’m a walking anxiety ball). Get up, wash your face go for a walk, read that book you love, surround yourself with positive energy. When you ignore anxiety even for 10 seconds you feel amazing don’t you? You feel like your life is amazing and nothing can bring you down right? Well there’s so many ways to do 

If you’re having health anxiety STOP GOOGLING your symtpoms. Anything you say or google on there will tell you the biggest bull shit ever. Instead, go see a doctor to clear your mind and stop googling. And gives you an obsession and you start to live on the edge and you’re always scared. Once you stop googling you’ll realize how amazing your life is.


Work anxiety. Get up and go to work. You’ve done it once and a billion times you can do it again. Go to that job interview with confidence and get that job. The pandemic has ruined us all and has made us all anti social and we all developed social anxiety. You will one day be yourself again. 

You guys don’t know the power of your mind till you train it become what you want to be. You wanna be miserable your whole life? That’s what you’ll be. You want to be happy and peaceful your whole life? That’s what you’ll be. Now I’m not saying every single day is filled with joy and peace. BUT it will be better than it is now when you start today. 

Goodluck to those struggling",2021-09-22 19:02:38

pt7c8m,My Anxiety Dropped me 😔,"Every day seems like another giant to be slain, in a never-ending battle. You just survive each day, hour, minute at a time. And sometimes it takes everything you have just to do that.

I have not discussed this exhaustively, however the last 3–4 months have likely been the most noticeably awful a great time. I actually don't want to speak exhaustively about the specific issue, yet it's an exceptionally essential piece of my life

 **You feel a particular sort of tension on your heart**  but it is neither physical nor abstract. You just feel a certain pressure.I affirmed it from a youtube video. So you can't tell individuals that you are having heart issues. It is more an inclination than genuine torment. 

 **The second thing that everything appears to be a haze.**  You commonly can't monitor time. You don't have a clue when you dozed and when you woke up. However, every time you wake you simply need to rest. No motivation to get up.You begin presuming that you are experiencing narcolepsy. 

 **You may become suicidal**..  

You appeal to God for your passing. You think the world is a jail. It's anything but a spot to live. It is far more terrible than damnation.

You do not give opinions in any matter and do not plan anything cause nothing matters to you whether your goals or your loved ones.

You simply need to be distant from everyone else in light of the fact that you are now forlorn in any event, sitting in a gathering of companions. You would prefer not to talk. You begin feeling fine with it.

 **It can't be envisioned, it can't be felt, it very well may be recently capable.**  Thus, don't advise it to individuals who have no involvement in it, it causes more sadness. Even if it is cured *it leaves a mark on your personality* ***forever.*** You always retreat back into the depressed state even at little problems. Depression becomes your worst fear. But you really learn from it. ***It is pain of the soul, indeed.***

pt74u2,Health Anxiety - Really Little black speck that comes and goes randomly in my eye? possibly overthinking and it’s normal.,"It’s not a floater because i have a floater, it’s like a random black speck that comes and goes really quick. It’s never in my direct vision and when i try look for it it’s never there. It’s when i look at something quickly and in my peripheral i see the little black speck and then it goes it’s small. Is it just due to the lighting, i suffer with anxiety and stress and been very tired recently too. I have had my eyes tested and they are completely fine too. Or just normal thing eyes do maybe? lol",2021-09-22 18:35:36

pt717k,Let your light shine!,"Congrats /r/anxiety we've all made it to Wednesday!

This is a weekly thread that serves as a place for us to shine some light on what is going well in our lives. It is easy for mental health subreddits to focus primarily on the negative, after all we're not here because everything is going wonderfully.

But, once in a while you get shown the light in the strangest of places if you look at it right. So whether you made it out of bed today, spoke up in a meeting or class, rode the bus, or just stepped outside please share with us what went well for you in the past week.

Any accomplishment, victory, positive thought or action no matter how big or small is welcome here!",2021-09-22 18:30:16

pt6qqu,Accept anxiety as a part of who you are,"Yesterday I was talking to a friend about my anxiety and he said something along the lines of: ""The biggest struggle is to accept that you have this condition. Don't ask yourself why this is happening, don't think that this shouldn't be happening to you or that you didn't deserve it. Accept anxiety as a part of who you are in order to move forward and actually battle this disorder. Having anxiety does not make you less than anyone, if anything it makes you stronger. And believe me, no one in this world is without a problem."" I will try to remember this and I wanted to share his wisdom with you guys. :)",2021-09-22 18:13:47

pt6eeh,Why am I getting hypnic jerk when falling asleep?,"
I’m not stressed out or anything. But when I try to fall asleep hypnic jerk would stop me from sleeping. I have health anxiety problems in the past but these couple of weeks have been solid so far. It’s already 7 am and I can’t sleep! I have a presentation this afternoon.",2021-09-22 17:52:58
pt6d1t,Anxiety preventing me from sleeping well,"Hi everybody,

I’m lying in bed right now as I type this, having woken up in the middle of the night yet again for an hour, only to fall back asleep and wake up with a racing heart at 5:20 a.m.

All of this started a little over a week ago, when my partner and I started packing to move apartments. I’d wake up at 5am no matter what time I fell asleep and couldn’t get myself to go back to sleep for even a little bit longer. It’s now at the point where I’ll wake up for a little bit at 3am, usually for only 15 minutes before going back to sleep and waking up at 5. I struggle with GAD and have a few other things on my plate right now in addition to moving: started a new job and my father has cancer. These things seem to have piled up, especially with my dad, and I’m pretty sure that’s where my anxiety is rooted.

I never had any issues sleeping until a little over a week ago, and I don’t know how to fix it. I’m currently taking Magnesium, specifically this one called Triple Calm that has a mix of Taurate, Glycinate, and Malate. I take one at night and in the morning. It seems to be helping a little bit but I’m really struggling with staying asleep, falling asleep I have no issues with. I’m also in therapy right now, and I’m hoping to discuss this with my therapist my next session.

Do you guys have any techniques or experiences with medication that could  help me with this? I’m planning on calling my doctor today, and taking prescription medication makes me somewhat anxious, I don’t know what to do.",2021-09-22 17:50:41
pt68mm,Anyone else do this?,Not all the time but if i have allot going on i will talk to myself like mumble under my breath so i can hear what i am saying better rather than thinking about it. Not like a full on conversation with myself just if i have things i need to do or i question myself about certain things to try make things better and what not. Sometimes i think about the past and tell myself the way it was because of this and that but things will get better because i am doing this and that. This normal? this just classed as over thinking haha.,2021-09-22 17:43:25
pt67qk,I don't answer the phone unless I'm mentally prepared,"Which I usually am not, if I'm not expecting a call back. It would usually be beneficial to answer quicker and not put it off but sometimes the stress just gets overwhelming. And I've had those calls in the past when I've answered even though I've had no energy to deal with it and it hasn't been very  beneficial.

I just ignored an important call and now I need to call them back or try to answer the next time they call again. Damn it

UPDATE answered them today after second call, it didn't go particularly well but at least I was reached. I failed to concentrate and just waited for the call to be over. Also got new phone calls which I will leave replying to until tomorrow... I will soldier through it on Friday and during the weekend, hopefully, won't be asked about anything important. Tysm for your answers",2021-09-22 17:41:56

pt616u,Coping with changing events in life,"Hey guys, 

Im a long time Follower of this thread just looking to see if anyone else had similar problems as I had. But now I’ve decided to seek some advice from you guys:

About me: I’m a 22 y/o Irish guy who was raised in Germany who has had self confidence issues pretty much my entire life. I’m a little bit of a loner - implying I only need people around me that I am close to and those that I feel comfortable with. I only seek out contact with other people when I feel comfortable with doing so.

My biggest issue: since I have started going to university I have felt nothing but anxiety in pretty much everything that I do. Since university has moved online I have felt very comfortable in what I have been doing because I’ve always had a sort of „safe-space“ at home which has made dealing with my issues a lot easier. Now that university is starting to move back „offline“ again I am starting to feel more and more anxious about the coming term and how my performance in general is going to be like (albeit I have passed all exams first time round so far.)

I realised when I heard that some courses will be offline, that I had gotten extremely dizzy and unwell with concern because I felt like I wasn’t ready to go back to the campus and break my routine which so far has worked so well for me.

My questions are:

=> Has anybody ever felt this way themselves in a similar situation? And if so, what do you do to beat that anxiety when it overcomes you?

=> How would my therapist (which I visit once a week) be able to help me and what kind of resources are available to deal with this type of thing?

All the best to you all out there :)

pt5whu,Emotionally unstable,"How do you guys deal with anxiety? People making you feel like shit all the time. I’m wayy too emotional to begin with. I’m an empath I feel things really deeply and my husband doesn’t. I cry all the time, there is nothing that I can do without crying. I tried neutral face, distraction, pinching myself.. nothing helped me. I feel immense pain when I’m emotionally hurt, I started cutting myself to keep me distracted from emotional pain to physical pain. It helped but made me even more miserable. I stopped doing that and started smoking cigarettes. Nothing helps please suggest something.",2021-09-22 17:22:36
